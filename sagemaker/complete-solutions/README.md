# Language Model Deployment with SageMaker JumpStart

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks, code, and instructions for selecting and deploying a language model using SageMaker JumpStart. The provided resources enable you to quickly deploy a powerful language model and create a Streamlit user interface for interacting with the model.

## Overview

The Language Model Deployment with SageMaker JumpStart folder provides a step-by-step guide and accompanying code to simplify the process of selecting and deploying a language model using SageMaker JumpStart. The notebooks cover model selection, deployment configuration, and include additional resources for building a Streamlit user interface.

## Contents

This folder includes the following components:

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the process of selecting an appropriate language model, configuring deployment settings, and deploying the model using SageMaker JumpStart.
- **Code**: Supplementary code files necessary for deploying the language model and setting up the Streamlit user interface.
- **Instructions**: Detailed instructions and documentation on using the notebooks and code to deploy the language model and the Streamlit user interface.

## Usage

To get started with deploying the language model and the Streamlit user interface:

1. Clone or download the contents of this folder to your local environment.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the documentation to run the notebooks sequentially and deploy the language model using SageMaker JumpStart.
3. Use the provided code and instructions to set up the Streamlit user interface, allowing interactive interactions with the deployed model.
