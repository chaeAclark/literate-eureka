the price of legacy





Chapter 1

The alley stank of piss and rotting vegetables, a familiar London perfume that made Thomas's nostrils twitch as he guided Sarah through the narrow passage between Brick Lane's crumbling buildings. Their plastic shopping bag crinkled with each step, filled with the cheap necessities of their shared poverty - instant noodles, off-brand cereal, the kind of bread that stays "fresh" for suspiciously long periods. "We should've waited until morning," Sarah said, her sixteen-year-old frame hunched against the February chill. Her secondhand coat hung loose on her shoulders, a hand-me-down from the foster system that had thrown them together three years ago. Thomas forced a smile, though his gut churned with an unfamiliar sensation. "And miss our midnight feast? Where's your sense of adventure, little sister?" The words came out wrong, thick and syrupy in his mouth. His hands felt hot, like he'd been holding them too close to a radiator. The sodium lights cast jaundiced shadows across the brick walls, transforming ordinary garbage bags into crouching monsters. Thomas's vision swam, the edges of reality seeming to ripple like heat waves off summer pavement. Something was wrong. Very wrong. They were halfway down the alley when the first thug stepped out from behind a dumpster. Two more materialized from the shadows, blocking their retreat. The leader, face half-hidden under a pulled-down beanie, flicked open a switchblade that caught the sickly light. "Wallet and phone," he said, voice flat as week-old beer. "Quick and quiet, yeah?" Thomas stepped in front of Sarah, his hands trembling now - not from fear, but from something else, something that made his bones feel like they were trying to crawl out of his skin. "Take what you want," he managed, "just let us-" The second thug grabbed Sarah's arm, yanking her away. She yelped, the sound triggering something deep and primal in Thomas's chest. The heat in his hands exploded into white-hot agony. Reality fractured. The air itself seemed to tear, like fabric ripping along invisible seams. Raw power erupted from Thomas's palms in streams of corrupted light that tasted like copper and screamed like dying stars. The thug holding Sarah was lifted off his feet, his body contorting as the magic wrapped around him like hungry serpents. "Thomas!" Sarah's voice cut through the roaring in his ears. "Thomas, stop!" But he couldn't stop. The magic poured out of him like pus from an infected wound, warping the very geometry of the alley. Brick walls began to bubble and flow like wax. The thugs' screams turned liquid, their bodies twisting into impossible shapes before they could even try to run. Thomas fell to his knees, retching up strings of luminescent matter that crawled across the ground like living things. His skin felt too tight, like it might split open and release whatever demon had taken residence in his flesh. Through tears of blood, he saw Sarah reaching for him. "Don't-" he tried to warn her, but it was too late. The magic caught her like a wave catching a piece of driftwood. Her eyes went wide with recognition, then horror, then something else entirely as the power began its work. The last thing Thomas saw clearly was her mouth forming his name, before reality itself bent around her like a lens, and everything went terribly, irrevocably wrong.
The magic stopped flowing, but reality remained broken. Thomas knelt in the twisted remains of the alley, his body wracked with dry heaves that brought up nothing but threads of luminescent spittle. The walls around him had melted and rehardened into obscene shapes, brick flowing like wax into formations that hurt the eyes to look at directly. Even the puddles on the ground had transformed, becoming mirrors that reflected impossible angles and fragments of other places. Sarah lay three feet away, though "lay" wasn't the right word. Her body had become a sculpture of flesh and bone that defied euclidean geometry, limbs folded through themselves in ways that made Thomas's mind skitter away from comprehension. Her face, thank whatever cruel gods existed, was turned away from him. But her hand - still recognizably her hand, with the cheap mood ring she'd bought last week - reached toward him in a gesture frozen between supplication and accusation. "Sarah?" His voice cracked like thin ice. "Sarah, I'm sorry, I'll fix it, I'll-" He crawled toward her, his palms leaving smoking handprints on the warped pavement. The closer he got, the more wrong everything felt. Space itself seemed to bend around her transformed body, as if reality was still trying to process what had happened. The thugs were there too, or what remained of them. One had become a twisted column of meat that spiraled up into the darkness. Another had simply... unfolded, spread across the alley walls like a Jackson Pollock painting rendered in viscera. The third was nowhere to be seen, though a strange shadow on the ground suggested he might have fallen through into somewhere else. Thomas reached for Sarah's outstretched hand. His fingers brushed hers, and a jolt of residual magic sparked between them. Her flesh was still warm, but it felt wrong - like touching something that existed in more dimensions than it should. Her mood ring had melted into her finger, the liquid metal now pulsing with the same sickly light that had poured from Thomas's hands. "Please," he whispered, though he didn't know what he was pleading for. The universe had already answered with brutal finality. A sound escaped his throat - not quite a laugh, not quite a scream. It echoed off the twisted walls and came back wrong, like the alley itself was mocking his grief. He could feel something inside him, a well of power that hadn't been there before, or maybe had always been there but hidden. It felt like swallowing a star, like being hollowed out and filled with acid. "I didn't mean to," he told Sarah's corpse, as if confession could undo what had been done. "I didn't know. I didn't-" His words dissolved into sobs that shook his entire frame. Each tear that hit the ground sizzled and left tiny craters in the pavement. The shopping bag lay split open nearby, their meager groceries scattered and transformed. The bread had become something alive and geometric, folding and unfolding itself in patterns that made Thomas's head hurt. A tin of beans had imploded, its contents crystallized into structures that hummed at frequencies just below human hearing. Time became fluid, stretching and contracting like a fever dream. Thomas stayed there, kneeling in the wreckage of his old life, watching reality slowly stabilize around him. The warped walls stopped shifting. The impossible angles began to settle into merely improbable ones. Even the air, which had tasted of ozone and copper, started to return to London's familiar mixture of pollution and decay. But Sarah remained transformed, a monument to what uncontrolled power could do to flesh and bone and love. Thomas found himself studying the details of her transformation, his mind trying to make sense of the senseless. The way her school uniform had fused with her skin in places, creating patterns like stained glass. The geometric precision of her exposed bones, now arranged in spirals that suggested mathematical principles he'd never learned. In the distance, sirens began to wail - not the familiar sound of police or ambulance, but something deeper, more resonant. The sound seemed to vibrate in his teeth, in his bones, in the hollow space behind his eyes where the power still churned. "I'm sorry," he said one final time, knowing the words were worse than useless. "I'm so sorry, little sister." Then the air crackled with new energy, and figures in robes began appearing at both ends of the alley, their hands raised and glowing with controlled purpose. Thomas didn't resist when the darkness finally came for him. He welcomed it.
They materialized from the warped shadows like ink bleeding through paper - figures in charcoal robes that seemed to absorb the sickly light. Their movements were precise, mechanical, a choreography of contained violence that made Thomas think of surgical instruments being arranged on a tray. "Subject is conscious. Power readings exceed Level Four parameters." The voice came from behind a mask that looked like hammered bronze, its features suggesting a face without quite achieving one. "Multiple casualties. Reality distortion extends approximately twelve meters in all directions." Thomas tried to speak, but his tongue felt swollen, alien in his mouth. He could taste colors now - the red of Sarah's mood ring had a flavor like copper and regret. The world tilted sideways, gravity becoming a suggestion rather than a law. "Containment protocol initiated." Another figure approached Sarah's transformed body, holding what looked like a surveyor's tool made of bone and glass. It hummed at frequencies that made Thomas's teeth ache. "Significant morphological alterations to organic matter. Subject demonstrates unprecedented raw potential." "Please," Thomas managed, the word coming out twisted. "My sister..." "Silence." The command carried weight beyond mere sound, pressing Thomas's vocal cords into submission. A robed figure knelt beside him, bronze mask reflecting his own distorted face. "Thomas Blackwood. Your parents' file indicated potential manifestation, but this..." The mask tilted, studying him like a curious insect. "This exceeds expectations." Parents. The word cut through his fog of grief and shock. "You knew-" "Helena," the masked figure called out, ignoring him. "Assessment?" A woman stepped into view, her robe hood pushed back to reveal severe features and prematurely graying temples. She held up a hand, and Thomas felt something probe at the edges of his consciousness - clinical, cold, like latex-gloved fingers searching for a vein. "Raw power comparable to the Corvus incident," she said, her voice carrying both awe and something darker. "The brand will be necessary. Immediately." The first masked figure made a sound like metal grinding on stone. "Are you certain? The boy's already unstable-" "Look at the reality fractures," Helena interrupted, gesturing at the twisted walls. "If we don't contain this now, the damage will spread. You've read the reports from Manchester." Thomas tried to follow their conversation, but the words kept sliding away from him. His attention fixed on another robed figure approaching Sarah's body with something that looked like a camera made of crystal and bone. Each flash of its not-quite-light made her transformed flesh ripple with impossible colors. "Don't," he pleaded, fighting against the command of silence. "Don't touch her-" Helena's hand pressed against his forehead, her skin unnaturally cool. "Sleep now, Thomas Blackwood. When you wake, we'll begin teaching you the price of power." Darkness crept in from the edges of his vision, but not before he saw them unfold what looked like a body bag made of shifting shadows. As consciousness faded, he heard Helena's voice one last time: "Contact Thornhaven. Tell them we've found another one. And inform the Board - the Blackwood line isn't as dead as we thought." The last thing Thomas saw was Sarah's hand, still reaching toward him as the shadow-bag enveloped her, the mood ring pulsing like a dying star.

Chapter 2

The sedatives wore off like layers of gauze unraveling from Thomas's consciousness, each thread pulling free to reveal the nightmare he'd been delivered to. Thornhaven Academy emerged from the London fog like a cancerous growth of Gothic architecture - all spires and gargoyles that seemed to twist when viewed from the corner of the eye. The magically-reinforced vehicle's windows vibrated with contained power as they passed through invisible barriers, each one sending waves of nausea through Thomas's gut. His hands still felt wrong, like they belonged to someone else. Someone capable of turning flesh into geometric puzzles, of warping reality until it screamed. He could smell Sarah on them, though he'd been scrubbed clean - not her usual scent of drugstore shampoo and borrowed perfume, but something metallic and multidimensional that made his sinuses burn. "Processing," announced the bronze-masked figure driving the vehicle. The word tasted of antiseptic and institutional fluorescent lights. They pulled into a courtyard where shadows moved wrong, flowing against the weak morning light like oil on water. Thomas was guided - firmly but without obvious restraint - through doors that seemed to digest them into the building's stone bowels. The corridors twisted at angles that hurt his mathematical sensibilities, lined with portraits whose eyes followed with more than painted persistence. "Strip," ordered a severe woman in a charcoal uniform, her face as blank as an unused form. They stood in a processing room that smelled of chalk dust and old blood. "Everything goes in the bin. You'll be issued appropriate attire." Thomas complied with numb fingers, each article of clothing carrying memories he couldn't bear to examine. His jeans still had Sarah's grocery list in the pocket, her handwriting looping with teenage flourishes. He watched them disappear into a bin marked with symbols that crawled across its surface like living things. The examination that followed was clinical but somehow obscene. They measured him with instruments that hummed at frequencies that made his molars ache. Drew blood with needles that seemed to bend through extra dimensions before finding his veins. Recorded his magical signature in crystals that cracked and wept luminescent fluid when exposed to his raw energy. "Extraordinary," murmured one of the technicians, watching the ruined crystals dissolve. "We haven't seen readings like this since-" "That's quite enough," interrupted another voice. Helena Vale stood in the doorway, her severe beauty made harsh by the institutional lighting. "Get him dressed and registered. The Board is already asking questions." They gave him clothes that felt wrong against his skin - uniform pieces that had been treated with spells he could taste on his tongue. Each button was inscribed with tiny wards that prickled against his fingers. The tie tried to knot itself around his neck before he fought it into submission. "Follow," commanded a new figure - young, probably only a few years older than Thomas, with the blank eyes of someone who had learned to stop seeing what happened in places like this. They walked through corridors that seemed to digest them, passing rooms where muffled sounds suggested lessons or tortures or both. The registration office contained a device that looked like a medieval torture instrument redesigned by a mathematician having a nervous breakdown. Bronze and crystal components shifted uneasily as Thomas approached. "Place your hands on the plates," instructed the clerk, her voice carrying the weight of ancient bureaucratic authority. "This will only hurt if you resist." Thomas complied, and reality hiccuped. Power surged through the device, making the crystals shriek at frequencies that existed somewhere between sound and color. One exploded in a shower of geometric shards that hung in the air for a moment before dissolving into mathematical concepts. "Sweet fucking Christ," breathed the clerk, dropping her professional demeanor. "What are you?" Thomas stared at his hands, seeing again what they had done to Sarah, to the thugs, to reality itself. "I don't know," he answered honestly. "I don't know anymore." They led him toward the student dormitories after that, through wards that made his skin feel like it was trying to crawl off his bones. Other students passed in the halls, their uniforms identical but their eyes all carrying different species of damage. Some watched him with predatory interest. Others with fear. A few with something worse - recognition. The building digested him deeper, and Thomas realized he could feel the wrongness of this place in his marrow. Power thrummed through the very stones, like the walls themselves were feverish. Somewhere in the distance, someone was screaming - either in pain or ecstasy or both. Welcome to Thornhaven, whispered something that might have been his conscience. Welcome to what you are becoming.
The dormitory room looked like it had been decorated by someone who'd read too much Lovecraft while high on laudanum. Dark wooden panels crawled up walls that seemed to bend inward at impossible angles, and the ceiling bore scorch marks in patterns that suggested failed containment spells. Two narrow beds hugged opposite walls, separated by what Thomas's fractured mind recognized as carefully calculated magical tolerances. His new roommate sprawled on the left-hand bed, shirtless and reading what appeared to be a textbook bound in something that wasn't quite leather. Marcus "Rook" Bishop's exposed torso was a canvas of ritual scars - precise geometric patterns that shifted uneasily when he breathed, like they were trying to solve themselves across his flesh. "Well, well," Rook drawled, not looking up. "They finally sent me fresh meat that's actually interesting." His voice carried the lazy menace of a cat playing with wounded prey. "I felt what you did in London, you know. We all did. Quite the entrance exam." Thomas's hands clenched involuntarily, and the nearest window crystal hummed in warning. "It wasn't an exam," he managed, the words tasting like ash and old pennies. "Everything's an exam here." Rook finally looked up, his eyes the color of badly healed bruises. "Even this conversation. They're watching, you know. Recording. Measuring our compatibility." He gestured at the corners of the room where shadows moved against the natural flow of light. "Hoping we either bond or kill each other. Either outcome works for their statistics." The casual way he spoke of death made Thomas's stomach lurch. He moved to his assigned bed, noticing how the sheets had been treated with dampening spells that made his skin crawl. His few issued possessions - uniform pieces, basic toiletries, a notebook that seemed to watch him - sat in a sad pile at the foot of the bed. "Your sister," Rook said suddenly, making Thomas freeze. "Did she scream when reality broke around her? Or did it happen too fast?" Raw power surged through Thomas before he could stop it. The light fixtures flickered, and one of the window crystals cracked with a sound like distant weeping. But Rook just smiled, his ritual scars pulsing with their own contained energy. "There it is," he purred. "That's what they want to see. The way you leak power like a broken reactor. Beautiful, really. Messy, but beautiful." "Shut up," Thomas whispered, but the words came out distorted, making the shadows in the corners writhe. "Just... shut up." "Can't sleep, can you?" Rook set his book aside, revealing cover symbols that squirmed uncomfortably. "Keep seeing her in your head? The way she looked after? That's normal. Well, normal for here. My first time was my brother. Turned him inside out during a fight over the TV remote. They told me he looked like a Klein bottle made of meat." Thomas wanted to scream, to run, to tear his way out of this nightmare. But the door had sealed behind him with wards he could taste like copper and old promises. He was trapped here with this smiling predator who treated tragedy like cocktail conversation. Night fell like a smothering blanket, bringing with it the distant sounds of other students crying or laughing or something in between. Thomas lay rigid in his bed, feeling the dampening spells try to contain the power that leaked from his pores. Rook's breathing became a metronome of mock peace, punctuated by the occasional shift of his scarred flesh against enchanted sheets. The dreams, when they came, tasted of Sarah's mood ring and screamed in colors that shouldn't exist. Thomas thrashed in geometric agony as reality warped around his unconscious power. The room's containment wards flared and sputtered, trying to handle the overflow of raw energy. "Fascinating," Rook's voice cut through the nightmare. He stood over Thomas's bed, watching with academic interest as space itself bent around the dreaming boy. "You're going to be so much fun to study." Objects began to twist - desk legs curling like dying spiders, books bleeding equations, the mirror in the corner reflecting angles that made geometry cry. Thomas's sheets smoldered where his fingers clutched them, burning away to reveal the mattress beneath starting to fold through itself. Rook reached down and grabbed Thomas's shoulder, his ritual scars flaring with controlled power. The contact sent feedback screaming through both their nervous systems. Thomas's eyes snapped open, leaking tears that sizzled when they hit the pillow. "There you are," Rook said softly, his grip painful but grounding. "Back in our little corner of hell. Don't worry about the damage. They expect it the first few nights. Part of their data collection." Thomas stared at their point of contact, where Rook's scars seemed to reach toward him like hungry vines. "Why... why help?" Rook's smile was all teeth and secrets. "Because you're powerful enough to be useful, broken enough to be malleable, and just sane enough to be interesting. Now go back to sleep. Tomorrow's orientation, and Professor Vale doesn't appreciate students who nod off during her lectures about proper magical containment." He returned to his bed, leaving Thomas to watch the room slowly unknot itself, reality settling back into merely improbable angles. The burns in his sheets formed patterns that looked almost like words in a language he didn't want to learn. Welcome to Thornhaven indeed.
Professor Helena Vale's office existed in deliberate defiance of right angles. Books crawled up the walls like literary ivy, their spines writhing with titles that refused to stay still. A brass contraption that might have been a telescope in a more rational universe tracked Thomas's movements, its lenses dilating like mechanical pupils. "Sit," Vale commanded, gesturing to a chair that looked like it had been grown rather than built. Her severe beauty carried the weight of carefully contained power, gray streaking her temples like frozen lightning. "Your night terrors caused quite a disturbance in the ward matrices. Impressive, if inconvenient." Thomas sank into the chair, which shifted uncomfortably beneath him. The air felt thick with accumulated magic, decades of spells leaving a residue he could taste like old wine gone to vinegar. "I didn't mean to-" "Intent," Vale cut him off, "is largely irrelevant here. Power demands containment, regardless of its wielder's wishes." She lifted a crystal sphere from her desk, its surface clouded with shifting patterns. "Your parents understood that, eventually. Though not before their resistance cost dozens of lives." The mention of his parents sent a jolt through Thomas's system. Power leaked from his pores, making the nearest bookshelf shudder. Vale's eyes narrowed with clinical interest as three books spontaneously reorganized themselves into non-Euclidean arrangements. "You have questions," she said, setting down the sphere. "Ask them. But understand that some answers may be... unsuitable for your current level of containment." Thomas fought to control his breathing, to keep his power from warping more of reality. "Were they really resistance fighters? Or just murderers?" "Such clean categories you still believe in." Vale's smile held no warmth. "Your mother, Diana, led the last serious attempt to dismantle the magical hierarchy. Her methods were... effective. Until they weren't." She opened a drawer, removing a folder that smelled of old blood. "Your father provided the theoretical framework for combining combat magic with ritual enhancement. Quite brilliant, really. The results were spectacular, in all the worst ways." The folder contained photographs that made Thomas's eyes hurt - scenes of devastation that suggested his parents had treated reality like a canvas for their revolution. His stomach lurched as he recognized the same geometric patterns he'd created in that London alley. "The power bred true," Vale mused, watching his reaction. "Though you seem to have surpassed them in raw potential. Which makes you valuable. And dangerous." She reached for the crystal sphere again, but this time it responded to her touch, filling with swirling darkness. "Tell me, do you dream of someone called Corvus?" The name sent an electric current down Thomas's spine. His chest burned suddenly, like a brand being pressed into his flesh. The brass telescope thing swiveled frantically, its lenses clicking as it tried to track the power now radiating from him in waves. "Interesting," Vale breathed, her professional mask slipping to reveal something hungrier. "The resonance is already establishing. Sooner than expected." She stood, moving around the desk with predatory grace. "Your education here will require... special attention. The standard curriculum won't be sufficient." "What's happening to me?" Thomas managed, his voice distorted by the power trying to claw its way out of his throat. The burning in his chest intensified. Vale placed her hand on his shoulder, and he felt her magic interacting with his - clinical, precise, like a surgeon's scalpel testing the edges of a wound. "You're becoming what your parents feared. What they fought against. What they ultimately failed to prevent." Her grip tightened. "And I'm going to help you survive it." The crystal sphere on her desk had gone completely black, its surface now reflecting impossible depths. As Thomas stared into it, he thought he saw something staring back - something old and patient and terribly, terribly interested in what he was becoming. "Welcome to Thornhaven," Vale whispered, her words carrying the weight of prophecy. "Let's see if you survive your inheritance."

Chapter 3

The combat training chamber resembled an autopsy room designed by a medieval torturer with architectural aspirations. Reinforced stone walls sweated with containment spells that made Thomas's teeth ache, and the floor bore blast marks in patterns suggesting mathematical proofs gone wrong. Iron rings studded the ceiling, trailing chains that clinked like wind chimes tuned to frequencies that shouldn't exist. Professor Augustus Crane stood at the center of it all, his missing right arm replaced by a construct of pure magic that shifted between forms like a fever dream - now a blade, now a hand, now something with too many fingers moving in directions that hurt to watch. His remaining flesh bore a topography of scars that suggested intimate knowledge of power's price. "Control," he barked at the assembled students, his voice carrying the gravel of someone who'd screamed too much in past lives. "Is the difference between mastery and mutation. Between purpose and pain." His magical arm crystallized into something like a conductor's baton. "Blackwood. Center." Thomas felt the other students pull away from him as he stepped forward. Their fear tasted like copper on his tongue. They'd all heard about London, about Sarah. Rumors spread through Thornhaven like cancer through tissue. "Basic channeling exercise," Crane announced. "Direct energy through the focus point. Nothing fancy." He gestured at a crystal suspended in one of the iron rings. "Just light it up." Thomas raised his hands, feeling power leak from his pores like sweat. The air grew thick, reality bending slightly around his fingers. The crystal hummed in anticipation. "Steady," Crane warned. "Like turning a tap, not breaking a dam." But Thomas's power didn't flow like water - it erupted like pus from an infected wound. The crystal flared brilliant white, then began to fold through itself, its geometry becoming something that shouldn't exist in three dimensions. Students backed away as reality rippled outward from the point of contact. "Contain it!" Crane's magical arm shifted to a complex pattern of wards. "Focus, boy!" Thomas tried, but the power kept coming, kept twisting. The crystal sang in frequencies that made several students cover their ears in pain. One girl started bleeding from her nose, geometric patterns forming in the droplets as they hit the floor. Crane moved with the swift precision of someone used to dealing with magical disasters. His construct-arm wrapped around Thomas's wrists, sending feedback screaming through both their nervous systems. The crystal shattered with a sound like reality hiccuping, its fragments hanging in the air for a moment before dissolving into mathematical concepts that rained down like toxic snow. "Interesting," Crane said softly, his grip painful but grounding. "You channel like your mother. All force, no finesse." His magical arm shifted again, becoming something that looked almost like a medical instrument. "But your father's theoretical framework is there, in the way reality bends. Dangerous combination." Thomas stared at the dissolving crystal fragments, seeing Sarah's transformed flesh in their fractals. "I can't control it," he whispered. "It just comes, like vomit, like-" "Like revolution?" Crane's smile held no warmth. "Your parents thought they could change the system through raw power too. You've seen how well that worked out." He released Thomas's wrists, leaving behind patterns that burned like brands. "Library has the full records. Restricted section. If you're curious about the price of uncontrolled change." The other students watched with predatory interest as Thomas stumbled back to his place in line. He could feel their calculation, their assessment of his weakness and strength. Rook, lounging against a wall, smiled like a cat watching wounded prey. "Next exercise," Crane announced, his construct-arm becoming something with edges that shouldn't exist. "Defensive wards. Partner up. Try not to permanently alter anyone's relationship with reality." Thomas felt the power still leaking from his hands, tasting of copper and old promises. The library, he decided. He needed to know what other poisons he'd inherited besides this gift for breaking the world.
The restricted section of Thornhaven's library existed in a perpetual twilight, as if reality itself was too ashamed to shed full light on the knowledge contained there. Thomas felt the wards part like rotting velvet as he entered, Professor Crane's authorization still burning in his pocket like a lit cigarette. The shelves twisted upward at angles that made his inner ear revolt, books bound in materials he didn't want to identify shifting uneasily as he passed. Some whispered in languages that tasted like metal and regret. Others leaked fluids that crawled across their spines in patterns suggesting mathematical proofs of damnation. "Blackwood, Diana and James," he told the card catalog, a brass monstrosity that clicked and whirred like a mechanical cancer trying to solve itself. It spat out a reference number that burned itself into the air, leaving an afterimage that pointed deeper into the stacks. The files sat in a box that hummed with containment spells, wrapped in chains made of something that might have once been alive. Thomas's hands shook as he undid the bindings, power leaking from his fingers and making the nearest books shudder in their shelves. The first photograph showed a woman he recognized from childhood memories - Diana Blackwood, his mother, standing in front of a burning building. Her face bore the fierce beauty of revolution, but her hands... Thomas felt bile rise in his throat. Her hands were covered in geometric patterns that bent reality around them, just like his had in that London alley. "Subject demonstrates unprecedented control over localized reality distortion," read the attached report. "Theoretical framework provided by James Blackwood allows for precise targeting of spatial-temporal weak points. Casualty count from Operation Broken Crown: 23 confirmed, 15 missing (presumed translated to non-viable dimensional spaces)." More photographs spilled out, each worse than the last. A government building twisted into impossible shapes, its windows bleeding equations. A group of security officers transformed into living sculptures that screamed in fractal patterns. His father's notebooks, filled with diagrams that hurt to look at directly, showing how to fold space like origami made of flesh and bone. "The resistance requires escalation," read one of Diana's journal entries, the ink still wet after decades. "James's breakthroughs in applied topology allow us to strike at the very framework of their power. Yes, there are costs. There are always costs. But you can't break an oppressive system without breaking some of the people who maintain it." Thomas's power flared involuntarily, making the words ripple on the page. He saw Sarah in every victim, her body transformed by forces that didn't care about intent or justice. His parents hadn't been fighting against monsters - they had become monsters, justifying each atrocity as a necessary step toward revolution. A loose page fluttered from the file, covered in his father's precise handwriting. The equations along its margins seemed to squirm under Thomas's gaze, but it was the content that made his blood freeze: "Project Corvus shows promise. The binding ritual could allow for power accumulation beyond normal human limitations. Diana disagrees with the ethical implications, but she'll understand when we succeed. Some prices are worth paying for true change." "Fascinating reading, isn't it?" Rook's voice cut through his revelation. His roommate lounged against a bookshelf that bent away from his touch, ritual scars pulsing with contained power. "Though you're missing the best parts. The really juicy bits about what your parents were willing to sacrifice. About what they were trying to become." Thomas looked up, seeing the predatory interest in Rook's eyes. "How long have you been watching me?" "Long enough to see you're following their footsteps." Rook's smile was all teeth and secrets. "The same power, the same justifications, the same inevitable descent. Though I think you'll fall faster. You've got a better teacher than they did." The brand on Thomas's chest burned at those words, and reality rippled around them like heat waves off summer pavement. The library's shadows grew deeper, hungrier, as power leaked from Thomas's trembling hands. "What do you know about Corvus?" Thomas demanded, but Rook was already backing away, still wearing that knowing smile. "Ask your chest," he said. "Ask the brand that's growing there. Ask the power that's eating you alive, just like it ate them." He disappeared into the stacks, leaving Thomas alone with the evidence of his inheritance. The photographs seemed to watch him with dead eyes as he stumbled away from the file, each image a prophecy of what he might become. His parents had thought they could control it too, thought they could direct the corruption toward justice. But power had its own agenda, its own appetite. And somewhere in his chest, something that felt like Corvus smiled.
"You smug fucking vulture," Thomas snarled, pursuing Rook through library stacks that twisted like dying snakes. Power leaked from his hands, making reality bubble and warp in his wake. Books shuddered on their shelves, some weeping ink, others whispering in languages that tasted like battery acid and broken promises. Rook moved with practiced grace, his ritual scars pulsing with controlled energy. "That's right," he called back, voice dripping with manufactured pleasure. "Chase me. Show me what Diana Blackwood's son can really do. Show me how the apple rots just like the tree." The brand on Thomas's chest burned at his mother's name, sending waves of nausea through his nervous system. Reality rippled around him like heat waves off summer pavement. A shelf of ancient texts burst into geometric flames that consumed knowledge rather than matter, leaving behind holes in space shaped like forgotten theorems. "What do you know about Corvus?" Thomas demanded, rounding a corner to find Rook waiting, posed like a predator about to strike. "What do you know about this fucking brand?" "I know it's eating you alive," Rook's smile was all teeth and surgical precision. "Just like it ate them. Your parents thought they could control it too, thought they could use Project Corvus to break the system." His ritual scars writhed like hungry worms. "Want to see how that worked out for them?" Thomas's power erupted before he could stop it, warping the air between them into crystalline patterns that sang in frequencies that shouldn't exist. Rook countered with a gesture that sent his scars bleeding controlled energy, creating a barrier of calculated corruption that deflected Thomas's raw force. The library around them began to transform. Books melted into each other, their contents cross-breeding into blasphemous new texts. The floor folded through itself like a Möbius strip trying to solve for madness. Reality groaned under the pressure of their clashing magics. "That's it," Rook purred, his eyes reflecting impossible angles. "Just like mommy dearest. All that power, all that righteous anger. But you want to know the real kicker?" He reached into his shirt and pulled out a familiar page - one that had gone missing from Thomas's parents' file. "Want to know what finally broke them?" The brand on Thomas's chest flared like a hot coal, and suddenly he could taste Rook's next words before they came, could feel them burning in his own throat like vomited prophecy. "They tried to bind Corvus," they said together, Thomas's voice overlapping with Rook's in a harmony that made nearby books bleed equations. "They tried to contain what couldn't be contained." Horror rose in Thomas's gut as he realized the words hadn't been his own. Something else had spoken through him, something that pulsed in his chest like a second heart pumping poison. Rook's smile widened impossibly. "There he is. Right on schedule." He backed away as reality began to unknot itself, the library's wards struggling to contain the aftermath of their clash. "Better hurry back to your room, Thomas. First vision's always the worst. Like birth in reverse - the death of who you thought you were." Thomas tried to pursue, but the brand's burning had become unbearable. He fell to his knees amid the wreckage of warped books and twisted space, power leaking from every pore. Through blurred vision, he saw his hands were covered in geometric patterns identical to those in his mother's photographs. "Ask your chest," Rook's voice echoed back through the stacks. "Ask what's growing there. Ask what your parents really died trying to become." The library's shadows grew longer, hungrier, as Thomas knelt in the ruins of his confrontation with Rook. The brand pulsed like a messenger arriving with news of damnation, and somewhere in the darkness, something ancient and patient smiled.
Thomas stumbled into his dormitory room, power leaking from his pores like fever sweat, reality bending around him in nauseating waves. The brand on his chest burned with such intensity that he'd torn his shirt open, revealing geometric patterns spreading across his skin like a cancer made of mathematics. The room twisted to accommodate his corrupted presence. Desk legs curled like dying spiders, the mirror wept mercury tears, and the walls breathed in frequencies that shouldn't exist. Even the containment wards pulsed erratically, trying to process the wrongness emanating from his flesh. "Please," he whispered to no one, to everyone, to the thing growing inside him like a tumor made of old magic and older hate. "Please, I don't want-" The brand exploded into white-hot agony, and reality shattered. He was falling through memories that weren't his own, drowning in experiences that tasted like copper and betrayal. A younger Thornhaven materialized around him, its stones less corrupted but no less hungry. Through eyes that weren't his, he watched students practice rituals that made his/their stomach churn with recognition. "Power demands revolution," someone was saying, a voice like grinding stones and broken promises. "The system must be unmade, unraveled, reborn through necessary violence." Thomas felt himself speaking with that voice, felt the weight of decades of gathered power and festering resentment. Students looked up at him - at Corvus - with the same mixture of fear and awe that they now showed Thomas. The brand pulsed in time with these borrowed heartbeats, each throb sending waves of nausea through both past and present. "Get out," Thomas tried to scream, but his voice emerged in Corvus's ancient tones. "Get out of my head!" The vision shifted, fractal patterns blooming behind his eyes like flowers made of broken glass. He saw his parents, younger and desperate, attempting a ritual that made reality scream. Diana's hands were covered in the same geometric patterns that now marked Thomas's flesh. James stood in a circle of symbols that crawled across the floor like hungry worms. "We can contain it," his father was saying, blood running from his nose in mathematical sequences. "We can use its power to break their system, to-" The memory dissolved into screaming colors as Corvus's presence surged through Thomas's nervous system like electrical current through wet copper. His back arched off the floor - when had he fallen? - as power coursed through him with the intensity of a spiritual rape. "Your parents thought they could control this too," Corvus's voice emerged from Thomas's own throat, the words tasting like grave dirt and vindication. "They thought they could bind me, use me, direct my hunger toward their revolution." A laugh that wasn't human. "But power isn't a tool, boy. Power is an appetite." Thomas convulsed as the brand's burning reached a crescendo. Reality warped around him like paper in flames, the room's dimensions folding through themselves in patterns that would have driven Escher mad. He caught glimpses of other times, other victims - students and teachers who had tried to contain what couldn't be contained, their bodies transformed into geometric sculptures that screamed in frequencies that shattered crystal. "You're mine now," Corvus whispered through Thomas's bleeding mouth. "Just like they were mine. Just like everyone who thinks they can control the hunger becomes mine in the end." The vision released him like a predator dropping wounded prey, leaving him gasping on the floor in a room that had been transformed by his power. The mirror now reflected angles that shouldn't exist, the desk had solved itself into a proof of non-euclidean geometry, and the walls wept equations that burned when they hit the floor. Thomas rolled onto his side, tasting blood and mathematics. The brand still burned, but duller now, like a satisfied parasite digesting its meal. He knew with horrible certainty that this was only the beginning - that Corvus would return, would continue to hollow him out and fill the spaces with ancient hunger and corrupted power. "There you are," Rook's voice came from the doorway. He surveyed the devastation with professional interest, his ritual scars pulsing in sympathy. "First communion's always the worst. But don't worry - you get used to being unmade." Thomas didn't respond. He was too busy watching geometric patterns spread across his trembling hands, knowing they matched his mother's in those final photographs. Knowing that he was becoming exactly what his parents had died trying to contain. And somewhere in his chest, in the brand that now bound him to something ancient and hungry, Corvus smiled with Thomas's own lips.

Chapter 4

The tunnels beneath Thornhaven reeked of old magic and desperate solutions. Thomas followed the directions Rook had mockingly provided, each step taking him deeper into the academy's rotting bowels. Pipes leaked substances that might have been water in a more rational universe, forming puddles that reflected angles that shouldn't exist. The walls sweated containment spells gone wrong, decades of leaked power creating cancerous growths of crystallized magic. His hands wouldn't stop shaking. The brand on his chest pulsed like a second heart pumping poison, each beat sending waves of nausea through his nervous system. Three days since Corvus's first visitation, and reality still rippled around him like heat waves off summer pavement. He needed help, needed control, needed something to stop the geometric patterns that kept spreading across his skin like mathematical infection. "You look like shit warmed over and served with theoretical physics sauce," called a voice from the shadows. Evelyn Cross emerged from a doorway that hadn't existed moments before, her face a roadmap of experimental scarring. Ritual marks crawled across her exposed skin like hungry worms, some still weeping fluids that glowed with unnatural possibilities. "But then, most of Corvus's toys do." Thomas flinched at the name, power leaking from his pores and making nearby pipes groan in sympathetic resonance. "How did you-" "Know?" Evelyn's laugh was all broken glass and bitter medicine. "Please. Everyone in the underground knows what's growing in your chest. We can taste it - like copper and old promises and that special flavor of fuck-you that comes with being chosen by something ancient and hungry." She led him through the doorway into a space that hurt his inner ear - a room that seemed to exist in more or fewer dimensions than it should, its corners solving mathematical equations that made geometry cry. Shelves lined the walls, holding bottles that contained everything from liquid darkness to crystallized screams. "Welcome to the pharmacy," Evelyn gestured at her wares with theatrical flourish. "Where good little magical prodigies come to deal with the side effects of institutional education. Want something to stop the visions? Dull the pain? Make the power feel less like it's eating you alive from the inside out?" Other students lurked in the shadows of her impromptu shop, their eyes reflecting desperate needs. One boy's skin rippled with barely contained transformations. A girl in the corner wept equations, each tear burning holes in the floor that led to places that shouldn't exist. "I need control," Thomas said, watching geometric patterns spread across his trembling hands. "I need to stop it from-" "From turning you into mommy and daddy dearest?" Evelyn's scarred face twisted into something between a smile and a wound. "Sorry, sweet thing, but that ship's already sailed, hit an iceberg, and sank into non-euclidean waters. Best I can offer is management of symptoms." She reached for a bottle containing what looked like liquid darkness shot through with veins of burning light. "This'll dull the brand's burn, make Corvus's visits feel more like heavy petting than full spiritual rape. Side effects include reality distortion, temporal displacement, and the occasional bout of speaking in tongues that taste like mathematics." Thomas watched the bottle's contents swirl in patterns that reminded him of Sarah's transformed flesh. "How do you know so much about-" "About what's happening to you? Because I've seen it before, genius." Evelyn pulled down her collar to reveal a mass of scar tissue that pulsed with contained power. "Three years ago, I tried to enhance my abilities through experimental fusion. Ended up with something old and hungry taking up residence in my flesh. Not Corvus-level ancient, but hungry enough to teach me about power's real price." She pressed the bottle into his hands. The glass felt fever-warm, like skin on the verge of infection. "First one's free, because I'm a sucker for pretty boys with tragedy in their blood. But next time, you'll need to contribute to my research. The underground runs on collaboration and shared suffering." "Research into what?" Thomas asked, even as the brand in his chest seemed to reach toward the bottle's contents like a starving thing scenting meat. Evelyn's smile was all teeth and broken promises. "Into breaking the system, of course. Just like your parents tried to do. Just like everyone tries to do until they realize the system isn't just corrupt - it's corruption itself, wearing an institution's skin." She leaned closer, her ritual scars pulsing in time with his brand. "But you want to know the real kicker? There's a group here, the Thornhaven Coven, who think they've found another way. Not revolution through force like your parents, but transformation through shared power. Through becoming something the system can't control because it can't comprehend." Thomas felt Corvus stir in his chest, interested despite itself. "And they can help with... this?" "Maybe. Maybe not. But they're meeting tonight in the old ritual chambers." Evelyn's scars writhed like hungry worms. "Follow the taste of copper and broken dreams. Just don't say I didn't warn you when you discover what real power costs in flesh and sanity." She turned away, already reaching for bottles to serve her next desperate customer. Thomas clutched his purchase, feeling the darkness inside respond to his touch like a living thing. The brand burned with fresh intensity, and somewhere in his chest, Corvus smiled with Thomas's own lips. The tunnels seemed darker as he left, the walls weeping power that tasted like addiction and justification. He had taken his first step into Thornhaven's underground, where students traded pieces of themselves for the illusion of control. Just like his parents had. Just like everyone did, in the end. And in his pocket, the bottle pulsed like a second heart, promising relief that would only lead him deeper into the hunger that was becoming his inheritance.
The ritual chamber crouched beneath Thornhaven like a tumor in the academy's stone bowels. Thomas followed the taste of copper and corruption through tunnels that twisted like intestines, geometric patterns spreading across his trembling hands as the brand in his chest pulled him deeper. Evelyn's potion sloshed in his pocket, darkness shot through with veins of burning light that seemed to reach toward his flesh through the glass. He found them in a space that shouldn't exist - a room whose corners solved equations that made reality weep. Seven students formed a circle, their bodies marked with ritual scars that pulsed in frequencies just below human hearing. Power leaked from their pores like fever sweat, collecting in pools that reflected impossible angles. "Well, well," drawled a girl whose flesh rippled with barely contained transformations. "Diana Blackwood's boy comes slumming." Her smile was all teeth and theoretical physics. "Come to follow mommy's footsteps into revolution through shared corruption?" The brand flared at his mother's name, sending waves of nausea through Thomas's nervous system. Reality bent around him like light through dirty glass. "I need control," he managed, tasting copper and old promises. "I need to stop it from-" "From eating you alive?" Another student stepped forward, his ritual scars forming patterns that reminded Thomas of Corvus's touch. "From hollowing you out and filling the spaces with something ancient and hungry?" He extended a hand covered in geometric burns. "I'm James. Not your father's James. Just another fuck-up trying to solve power's equation through collective madness." The circle opened to admit Thomas, and he felt their combined energy like a weight pressing against his skin. They were all marked, all carrying pieces of things that shouldn't exist inside human flesh. One boy wept equations that burned holes in the floor. Another's fingers solved themselves into fractal patterns when he gestured. "We don't offer control," James said, his scars pulsing in time with Thomas's brand. "We offer transformation through shared corruption. Through becoming something the system can't contain because it can't comprehend." They began to move, their bodies flowing through positions that hurt Thomas's inner ear. Power built in the chamber like steam in a pressure cooker, making the walls sweat containment spells that had gone cancerous with age. The air itself began to solve complex mathematical problems that shouldn't have answers. "Join us," the girl with fluid flesh whispered. "Let us show you what your parents never understood - that power isn't meant to be controlled. It's meant to be shared until it transforms us all." Thomas stepped into their circle, feeling Corvus stir in his chest like a parasite scenting fresh meat. The brand burned as the Coven's combined energy wrapped around him like hungry tentacles made of pure mathematics. Reality began to fold through itself, the chamber's dimensions multiplying and dividing by numbers that couldn't exist. But something went wrong. The power found the thing growing in Thomas's chest and recognized it like cancer recognizing its source. Corvus surged through his nervous system, using their shared energy as a conduit to touch all seven minds at once. Students screamed as ancient hunger flooded their consciousness. "No," Thomas tried to pull away, but it was too late. Reality shattered along theoretical lines as Corvus's power mixed with their ritual energies. One boy's flesh began solving equations that should have remained theoretical, his bones rearranging themselves into proofs of non-euclidean geometry. The girl with fluid flesh melted into angles that shouldn't exist, her screams dopplering through dimensional frequencies. "Break the circle!" James shouted, his ritual scars bleeding controlled corruption. "Before it-" But Corvus was already withdrawing, leaving devastation in its wake. The chamber's walls wept equations that burned like acid, and the air itself had developed a taste for solving human flesh into mathematical components. Three students lay transformed into sculptures that proved impossible theorems with their twisted bodies. The others staggered back, their ritual scars pulsing with sympathetic hunger. "Get out," James snarled, helping the girl with fluid flesh resolve back into approximately human shape. "Get out before it tries to solve us all." Thomas stumbled away, the brand in his chest burning with satisfied amusement. Corvus had shown him the futility of seeking control through shared power. In his pocket, Evelyn's potion pulsed like a second heart, promising temporary relief from the hunger that was becoming his inheritance. The tunnels digested him back toward familiar spaces, but Thomas knew he'd seen his future in that chamber - not in the Coven's failed attempt at collective transformation, but in the way Corvus had used their shared power to corrupt them all at once. Power wasn't meant to be controlled or shared. Power was meant to consume. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like a borrowed coat, Corvus smiled.
Professor Vale's office had transformed since Thomas's last visit, or perhaps he was finally seeing it clearly through Corvus-tainted eyes. The brass contraption that might have been a telescope now writhed like a mechanical serpent, its lenses dilating as they tracked the geometric patterns crawling across his skin. Books bled equations down the walls, solving themselves into proofs of corruption that made his inner ear revolt. "Quite the mess you've made," Vale said, her severe beauty hardened by shadows that moved against the candlelight. "Three students transformed by theoretical mathematics. Two more speaking in tongues that taste like copper and regret. The Coven's ritual chamber may never fully recover its dimensional stability." Thomas slumped in the chair that felt like it had been grown from pain rather than wood. The brand in his chest burned with fresh intensity, responding to something in Vale's presence that tasted like recognition. "I didn't mean to-" "Intent," she cut him off, "is becoming rather irrelevant, isn't it?" She moved around her desk with predatory grace, her fingers trailing patterns in the air that made reality hiccup. "Just like it was for your parents when Project Corvus first showed them power's true nature." The name sent feedback screaming through Thomas's nervous system. Power leaked from his pores, making nearby books shudder and weep dark fluids. "You knew. You knew what was growing in me, what the brand really means." "Of course I knew." Vale's smile held centuries of bitter knowledge. "I was there when your parents tried to bind Corvus. When they thought they could contain something that old, that hungry, and direct it toward revolution." She reached out and pressed her hand against his chest, directly over the brand. "I watched it consume them from the inside out, just like it's consuming you." Thomas tried to pull away, but her touch sent waves of nauseating recognition through his flesh. The brand pulsed like a second heart pumping poison, and for a moment he saw Vale through Corvus's ancient eyes - saw the marks it had left on her soul decades ago, saw how she had learned to live with corruption by becoming its willing vessel. "You have a choice," she said, though her smile suggested otherwise. "Let me teach you what your parents never learned - how to survive being hollowed out and filled with something older than human comprehension. Or continue stumbling through the underground, collecting scars and transformations until Corvus decides to solve you into its favorite shape." "And if I refuse both options?" Thomas managed, tasting copper and old promises on his tongue. Vale's laugh was all broken glass and institutional cruelty. "Oh, Thomas. You stopped having real choices the moment your power manifested in that London alley. Just like your parents stopped having choices when they discovered Project Corvus's true nature. Just like I stopped having choices when-" She pulled back suddenly, her own carefully contained power flaring in response to something moving beneath Thomas's skin. The brand burned white-hot, and reality rippled around them like heat waves off summer pavement. For a moment, Corvus looked out through both their eyes, recognizing its own handiwork across generations of corruption. "Tomorrow," Vale said, composing herself as reality settled back into merely improbable angles. "Come to my private laboratory after midnight. I'll show you what survival really costs in flesh and sanity." Thomas stumbled from her office, the brand pulsing with amused satisfaction. In his pocket, Evelyn's potion remained untouched, offering chemical escape that would only lead him deeper into power's appetite. But Vale had shown him a third path - not control, not transformation, but conscious surrender to the thing that was becoming his inheritance. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like a borrowed coat, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once.

Chapter 5

The black market tunnels beneath Thornhaven reeked of desperation and corrupted magic. Thomas followed the trail of leaked power like a junkie following the scent of his next fix, each step taking him deeper into the academy's rotting bowels. The brand on his chest burned with anticipation, recognizing the familiar taste of students trading pieces of themselves for the illusion of control. Evelyn Cross's underground pharmacy existed in a space that hurt his inner ear - a room that seemed to fold through more dimensions than it should, its corners solving equations that made geometry cry. She emerged from shadows that moved against the light, her face a roadmap of experimental scarring. Ritual marks crawled across her exposed skin like hungry worms, some still weeping fluids that glowed with unnatural possibilities. "Well fuck me sideways with non-euclidean geometry," she drawled, ritual scars pulsing in recognition. "If it isn't Diana Blackwood's boy, come to sample our institutional coping mechanisms." Her smile was all broken glass and bitter medicine. "Let me guess - the brand's burning, reality's getting slippery, and you need something to make Corvus's visits feel less like spiritual rape?" Thomas flinched at the name, power leaking from his pores and making nearby bottles hum in sympathetic resonance. "How did you-" "Know about your little chest decoration?" Evelyn's laugh tasted like copper and old promises. "Please. Everyone in the underground can smell it on you - that special flavor of fuck-you that comes with being chosen by something ancient and hungry." Other students lurked in the shadows of her impromptu shop, their eyes reflecting desperate needs. One boy's skin rippled with barely contained transformations. A girl in the corner wept equations, each tear burning holes in the floor that led to places that shouldn't exist. They all watched Thomas with the predatory interest of addicts recognizing fresh meat. "I need control," Thomas said, watching geometric patterns spread across his trembling hands. "Something to stop it from-" "From turning you into mommy and daddy dearest?" Evelyn's scarred face twisted into something between a smile and a wound. "Sorry, sweet thing, but that ship's already sailed, hit an iceberg, and sank into non-euclidean waters. Best I can offer is management of symptoms." She reached for a bottle containing what looked like liquid darkness shot through with veins of burning light. The contents swirled in patterns that reminded Thomas of Sarah's transformed flesh, of reality warping around his uncontrolled power. The brand in his chest reached toward it like a starving thing scenting meat. "This'll dull the burn," Evelyn explained, her ritual scars writhing like hungry worms. "Make the visions feel more like heavy petting than full possession. Side effects include reality distortion, temporal displacement, and the occasional bout of speaking in tongues that taste like mathematics." She pressed the bottle into his hands. The glass felt fever-warm, like skin on the verge of infection. "First one's free, because I'm a sucker for pretty boys with tragedy in their blood. But next time, you'll need to contribute to my research. The underground runs on collaboration and shared suffering." "Research into what?" Thomas asked, even as Corvus stirred in his chest, interested despite itself. Evelyn pulled down her collar, revealing a mass of scar tissue that pulsed with contained power. "Into breaking the system, of course. Just like your parents tried to do. Just like everyone tries to do until they realize the system isn't just corrupt - it's corruption itself, wearing an institution's skin." She leaned closer, her breath tasting of copper and broken dreams. "But you want to know the real kicker? There's a group here, the Thornhaven Coven, who think they've found another way. Not revolution through force like your parents, but transformation through shared power. Through becoming something the system can't control because it can't comprehend." The brand flared at her words, sending waves of nausea through Thomas's nervous system. Reality rippled around them like heat waves off summer pavement. "And they can help with... this?" "Maybe. Maybe not. But they're meeting tonight in the old ritual chambers." Evelyn's scars pulsed in time with his brand. "Follow the taste of copper and broken dreams. Just don't say I didn't warn you when you discover what real power costs in flesh and sanity." She turned away, already reaching for bottles to serve her next desperate customer. Thomas clutched his purchase, feeling the darkness inside respond to his touch like a living thing. The brand burned with fresh intensity, and somewhere in his chest, Corvus smiled with Thomas's own lips. The tunnels seemed darker as he left, the walls weeping power that tasted like addiction and justification. He had taken his first step into Thornhaven's underground, where students traded pieces of themselves for the illusion of control. Just like his parents had. Just like everyone did, in the end. And in his pocket, the bottle pulsed like a second heart, promising relief that would only lead him deeper into the hunger that was becoming his inheritance.
The abandoned bathroom on Thornhaven's third floor existed in a state of architectural decay that matched Thomas's deteriorating grip on reality. Cracked mirrors reflected angles that shouldn't exist, and the pipes leaked substances that might have been water in a more rational universe. The brand on his chest burned as he pulled Evelyn's bottle from his pocket, its contents swirling with veins of darkness shot through with burning light. "Just management of symptoms," he whispered, his voice distorting in the corrupted acoustics. The geometric patterns on his hands had spread past his wrists now, solving equations in his flesh that made his skin crawl. In the mirrors, his reflection fractured into theoretical possibilities - each version of himself bearing different configurations of Corvus's marking. The bottle felt fever-warm against his palm, its contents reaching toward him like a lover's tongue. He broke the seal, and reality hiccuped around him. The liquid inside tasted like copper and broken promises, burning its way down his throat like mathematical acid. For a moment, nothing happened except the usual background horror of existence. Then the world turned inside out. The bathroom's dimensions began to solve themselves into new configurations, tiles flowing like mercury into proofs of non-euclidean geometry. The mirrors wept equations that burned holes in the floor, revealing glimpses of other spaces, other possibilities. Thomas watched his hands dissolve into pure theory, each finger becoming a theorem that proved the impossibility of his continued existence. "Beautiful, isn't it?" Sarah's voice came from everywhere and nowhere, but when he turned, he saw her transformed body reflected in every mirror - a sculpture of flesh and bone that demonstrated principles of higher mathematics. "This is what power really feels like, brother. This is what we become." The brand erupted with white-hot intensity, and suddenly Corvus was there too, wearing Thomas's flesh like a borrowed coat. They spoke with one voice, tasting of copper and corruption: "The potion doesn't dull me, boy. It just makes you more... receptive." Reality bent around them like light through dirty glass. The bathroom's architecture began to digest itself, walls flowing into angles that hurt the mind. Thomas felt his body trying to solve equations that should have remained theoretical, his bones rearranging themselves into proofs of power's true nature. "Stop," he tried to say, but the word came out as a series of geometric patterns that stained the air like ink in water. "Please, I can't-" "Can't what?" Corvus purred through his mouth, their shared flesh rippling with contained energy. "Can't control it? Can't contain it? Just like your parents couldn't?" Their laugh tasted like battery acid and institutional decay. "Power isn't meant to be controlled, boy. Power is meant to consume." The mirrors exploded inward, each shard reflecting a different version of Thomas's corruption. Reality fractured along theoretical lines as his uncontrolled magic mixed with the potion's effects. The pipes burst, spewing fluids that solved themselves into living mathematics. The very air began to crystallize around him, forming patterns that sang in frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Thomas?" Professor Vale's voice cut through the chaos like a scalpel through infected flesh. She stood in what remained of the doorway, her severe beauty hardened by shadows that moved against the light. "Oh, you foolish boy. Did you really think Evelyn's little concoctions could help?" He tried to respond, but Corvus surged through his nervous system, using their shared flesh to reach toward Vale's carefully contained corruption. She raised a hand crackling with controlled power, and reality snapped back into something approximately normal, though the bathroom would never quite exist in only three dimensions again. "My office," she commanded as Thomas slumped against a wall that wept equations. "Now. It's time you learned what your parents never did - that there are better ways to survive being hollowed out." The brand pulsed with satisfied amusement as Thomas staggered after her, leaving behind a room that had been transformed by his failed attempt at chemical control. In his pocket, the empty bottle radiated fever-heat, its remaining drops solving themselves into proofs of his descent. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like a favorite suit, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once.
Vale's office had metastasized since Thomas's last visit, the corruption he'd glimpsed before now proudly displaying itself like tumors under glass. Books oozed theoretical fluids down walls that solved themselves into proofs of institutional decay. The brass device that might have been a telescope had evolved into something with too many joints, its lenses dilating like mechanical pupils as they tracked the geometric patterns crawling across Thomas's skin. "Quite the performance in the bathroom," Vale said, her severe beauty hardened by shadows that moved against candlelight. "Evelyn's potions tend to reveal what we're really becoming, don't they?" She gestured to a chair that looked like it had been grown from pain rather than wood. "Sit. It's time we discussed your... inheritance." Thomas slumped into the chair, feeling the brand pulse in his chest like a second heart pumping poison. The room's corrupted architecture seemed to lean in, hungry for what was about to transpire. "You knew," he managed, tasting copper and old promises. "You knew what was growing in me." "Of course I knew." Vale's smile held centuries of bitter knowledge. "I was there when your parents thought they could contain Corvus, direct its hunger toward revolution." She moved around her desk with predatory grace, her fingers trailing patterns in the air that made reality hiccup. "I watched it consume them from the inside out, just like it's consuming you." She reached out and pressed her hand against his chest, directly over the brand. The contact sent feedback screaming through both their nervous systems. For a moment, Thomas saw her through Corvus's ancient eyes - saw the marks it had left on her soul decades ago, saw how she had learned to live with corruption by becoming its willing vessel. "The institution doesn't want to stop power from corrupting us," Vale continued, her touch burning like institutional truth. "It wants to manage the corruption, direct it, use it. Your parents never understood that. They thought they could break the system through sheer force." Her laugh tasted like battery acid and broken dreams. "But the system isn't just corrupt - it is corruption, wearing academic robes and speaking in tenure-track tongues." The brand flared white-hot, and suddenly Corvus was there with them, wearing Thomas's flesh like a borrowed coat. They spoke with one voice, tasting of copper and vindication: "Show him what survival really looks like, Helena. Show him what you became." Vale's smile widened impossibly as she stepped back, power leaking from her pores like fever sweat. Reality bent around her like light through dirty glass as she let her careful containment slip. Her flesh rippled with theoretical possibilities, each movement solving equations that shouldn't have answers. The office's shadows reached toward her like hungry children recognizing their mother. "This is control," she said, her voice harmonizing with frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Not fighting the corruption, but directing it. Becoming something the system can use because it can't fully comprehend what we are." She gestured at the walls, where books wept dark knowledge. "Thornhaven doesn't want us pure. It wants us functional. Useful. Like tumors that have learned to file paperwork." Thomas watched geometric patterns spread past his wrists, his flesh proving theorems about power's true nature. "And if I refuse? If I try to fight it?" "Then you'll end up like your parents - twisted into shapes that prove only failure's theorem." Vale's form stabilized, corruption settling back beneath her academic skin. "Or you can let me teach you what they never learned. How to survive being hollowed out and filled with something older than human comprehension." The brand burned with satisfied amusement as Thomas considered her words. In his pocket, Evelyn's empty bottle radiated fever-heat, a reminder of failed attempts at chemical control. The geometric patterns on his hands solved themselves into new configurations, accepting truths he'd been fighting since that London alley. "When do we start?" he asked, and somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like a favorite suit, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. Vale's answering smile was all institutional inevitability. "We already have. Welcome to your real education, Thomas Blackwood. Let's see what you become." The office's shadows lengthened like hungry tongues as Thomas surrendered to his inheritance, accepting that control meant something very different in Thornhaven's corrupted halls. The brass device clicked and whirred, recording his descent for institutional records that would taste of copper and old promises.

Chapter 6

Vale's private laboratory existed in a space that had divorced itself from conventional geometry, like a tumor that had achieved mathematical sentience. Thomas followed her through a door that tasted of copper and institutional decay, his brand burning in recognition of corrupted territory. The walls seemed to breathe in frequencies that shouldn't exist, decorated with diagrams that solved themselves into new configurations when viewed directly. "Your parents," Vale said, arranging instruments that might have been surgical tools in a more rational universe, "thought power could be controlled through will alone." Her severe beauty had taken on an almost liquid quality in this space, her form suggesting theoretical possibilities. "They never understood that corruption requires... cultivation." The brand in Thomas's chest pulsed like a second heart pumping poison as Vale approached. Her hands left trails in reality like fingers through dirty water. "Remove your shirt," she commanded. "Let's see how far the patterns have spread." Thomas complied, revealing geometric theorems solving themselves across his flesh. The marks had crept past his chest now, each new line proving equations about power's true nature. Vale's touch was clinical but intimate as she traced the brand's edges, sending feedback screaming through both their nervous systems. "Beautiful," she breathed, her own carefully contained corruption reaching toward his. "Corvus has marked you more thoroughly than most. Like recognizing like." Her smile tasted of battery acid and vindication. "Now, let me show you what real training looks like." She guided his hands through positions that hurt his inner ear, teaching him to direct rather than resist the power leaking from his pores. Reality bent around them like light through dirty glass as she demonstrated how to shape corruption into academically acceptable forms. "Don't fight the hunger," Vale instructed as Thomas struggled to contain the geometric patterns trying to spread from his fingers. "Direct it. Like redirecting a river rather than damming it." Her own flesh rippled with controlled transformation. "Show me what you did in that London alley, but this time with purpose." The memory of Sarah's twisted body sent power surging through Thomas's nervous system. The laboratory's equipment began to solve itself into new configurations, brass and crystal components proving theorems about pain and institutional purpose. Vale's smile widened as she watched him struggle. "That's it," she purred, her voice harmonizing with frequencies that made nearby instruments weep. "Feel how the system wants to use your corruption? How it hungers for your transformation?" She pressed against his back, her hands guiding his movements. "Now, solve this for me." She indicated a brass device that might have been a microscope in a previous life. Thomas let his power flow through Vale's carefully constructed channels, feeling Corvus stir in his chest with interested hunger. The device began to transform, its components rearranging themselves into patterns that proved institutional theorems about power and control. "Perfect," Vale whispered as the transformation completed, leaving behind something that hummed with corrupted purpose. "You see? The system doesn't want to stop our corruption. It wants to direct it, use it, turn our hunger into something... productive." Thomas stared at his hands, watching geometric patterns solve new equations in his flesh. The brand burned with satisfied amusement as he realized what Vale was really teaching him - not control, but collaboration with the thing hollowing him out. The laboratory's shadows reached toward him like hungry children recognizing a new sibling. "Next lesson," Vale said, producing a crystal that sang in frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Let's see how thoroughly Corvus has prepared you for real education." And somewhere in Thomas's chest, wearing his flesh like a favorite suit, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once.
The dormitory corridors twisted like institutional arteries as Thomas made his way back from Vale's laboratory, his newly disciplined power leaving subtle distortions in reality rather than the raw warping of before. Students pressed themselves against walls as he passed, their own corruptions recognizing something more refined in his presence. The geometric patterns on his skin had spread past his shoulders now, each line solving equations about power's proper application. "Well, well," Rook's voice cut through the controlled chaos. "Someone's learned to wear their corruption like a proper academic." He lounged against a wall that bent slightly to accommodate his presence, ritual scars pulsing with knowing hunger. "Vale's been teaching you the institutional waltz, hasn't she?" Thomas felt Corvus stir in his chest, the brand burning with almost pleasant recognition. "She's showing me how to survive," he said, his voice carrying harmonics that made nearby crystals hum. "How to direct it instead of-" "Instead of fighting it? Like all those other students did?" Rook's smile was all teeth and terrible knowledge. "Come with me. There's something you should see about the price of improper transformation." They descended through layers of Thornhaven's architecture, each level more divorced from conventional geometry than the last. The walls wept equations that Thomas could now read - proofs about power's relationship with institutional authority. His brand pulsed in time with the corrupted ley lines that ran through the foundation stones. "The official term is 'administrative removal,'" Rook explained as they reached a door that shouldn't exist. "When students fail to properly channel their corruption into academically acceptable forms." His ritual scars writhed as he pressed his hand against the door's surface. "When they become... inconvenient." The room beyond defied euclidean principles, its corners solving themselves into testimonies of institutional horror. Glass cases lined the walls, each containing what might have been a student once - bodies transformed into sculptures that proved theorems about power's true cost. Thomas recognized the mathematical patterns in their twisted flesh, similar to what he'd done to Sarah but more... deliberate. "Marcus Chen," Rook indicated a case containing a form that folded through itself like a Klein bottle made of meat. "Tried to fight his corruption through sheer willpower. Ended up proving equations about futility with his bones." He moved to another case. "Emily Winters. Thought she could beat the system through pure talent. Now she demonstrates theoretical principles about institutional inevitability." Thomas watched geometric patterns crawl across his hands, each line now precisely placed rather than chaotically spreading. "How many?" "Dozens. Maybe hundreds." Rook's laugh tasted of copper and vindication. "The system doesn't waste anything - even failed students serve an educational purpose." He gestured at the cases. "These are the ones who couldn't or wouldn't learn what Vale's teaching you now. The ones who insisted on fighting rather than directing their corruption." A familiar face caught Thomas's attention - one of the Coven members who'd been transformed during their failed ritual. The boy's flesh had been arranged into perfect proofs of institutional authority, his eyes forever solving equations about power's proper channels. "That's why Vale took interest in you," Rook continued, his ritual scars pulsing with dark amusement. "She recognized your potential for proper corruption. Saw how Corvus was preparing you for real education." He pressed his hand against a glass case, leaving behind patterns that matched Thomas's own geometric markings. "The question is: will you keep dancing to the institution's tune, or will you join them in proving failure's theorem?" The brand in Thomas's chest burned with something between pleasure and hunger as he studied the transformed students. He could see now what he couldn't before - how their wild corruptions had been refined into academic examples, their rebellions redirected into institutional lessons. "I won't end up here," Thomas said, his voice harmonizing with frequencies that made the glass cases sing. "I'm learning to play their game." "Are you?" Rook's smile widened impossibly. "Or are you becoming exactly what they want - another properly corrupted piece in their academic machinery?" He gestured at their reflections in the glass, where Thomas's geometric patterns matched the institutional marks on the preserved students. "Look closely at what you're turning into. What Vale's helping you become." But Thomas was already seeing it - how his controlled corruption served the system's purposes, how his power now flowed through approved channels. The brand pulsed with satisfied amusement as he realized that even this revelation was part of his education. "Welcome to the real Thornhaven," Rook whispered as they left the room of failed students. "Where even our rebellions prove their theorems about power and control." The door sealed behind them, but Thomas could still feel the resonance between his geometric patterns and the transformed flesh beyond. He was becoming something the institution could use, his corruption being channeled into acceptable forms. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like a favorite suit, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once.
The corrupted ley lines beneath Thornhaven pulsed like infected veins, each throb sending waves of nauseating power through the stone foundations. Thomas followed Vale through tunnels that had divorced themselves from euclidean principles, his newly refined corruption leaving subtle distortions in reality rather than raw warping. The geometric patterns on his skin solved equations about institutional authority as they descended deeper into the academy's rotting heart. "The source," Vale said, her severe beauty taking on an almost liquid quality in the ley lines' sickly light. "Where power pools and corrupts and feeds the system that shapes us." She pressed her hand against a wall that felt fever-warm, leaving behind marks that matched Thomas's own patterns. "Your parents never understood this part - how the institution doesn't just contain power, it digests it." The chamber they entered defied conventional geometry, its architecture suggesting a stomach made of mathematics and old stone. Corrupted energy leaked from cracks in reality, forming pools that reflected impossible angles. Thomas felt Corvus stir in his chest as the brand recognized something ancient and hungry in the foundation's pulse. "Watch," Vale commanded, her flesh rippling with controlled transformation. She reached into one of the energy pools, drawing out strands of pure corruption that writhed like hungry worms. "This is what feeds Thornhaven. What gives it the strength to shape us into useful forms." Thomas saw how the ley lines connected everything - the classrooms above where students learned to channel their power, the laboratories where corruption was refined into academic purpose, even the hidden room where failed transformations were preserved as institutional examples. The whole academy was one vast digestive system, processing raw power into controlled corruption. "Your turn," Vale said, guiding his hands into the nearest pool. The contact sent feedback screaming through his nervous system as Corvus recognized its own essence in the ancient power. "Feel how it wants to shape you? How it hungers for proper transformation?" The geometric patterns on Thomas's skin began to solve new equations, each line aligning with the institution's underlying mathematics. He could taste copper and old promises as the ley lines' corruption reached toward his own, recognizing something useful in his controlled power. "The system feeds on us," he realized, watching reality bend around his fingers like light through dirty glass. "On our transformations, our corruptions, our-" "Our proper education," Vale finished, her smile all institutional inevitability. "Every student who learns to channel their power correctly adds to Thornhaven's strength. Even the failures serve a purpose, their twisted flesh proving theorems about institutional authority." Thomas felt the brand pulse in harmony with the ley lines' ancient hunger. The patterns on his skin had spread past his shoulders now, each mark precisely placed rather than chaotically spreading. He was becoming something the system could digest, his corruption being refined into academic nourishment. "Your parents tried to poison it," Vale continued, her hands trailing patterns in the corrupted energy that made reality hiccup. "Thought they could corrupt the corruption itself. But the system doesn't care about revolution or resistance - it only cares about processing power into useful forms." The chamber's architecture seemed to lean in, hungry for their combined corruption. Thomas could see now how everything connected - how Vale's training shaped him into something the institution could use, how even his attempts at control fed the system's appetite. The ley lines pulsed with satisfied hunger as he accepted his role in this academic ecosystem. "What am I becoming?" he asked, though the geometric patterns solving themselves across his flesh already proved the answer. Vale's laugh tasted of battery acid and vindication. "Exactly what Thornhaven needs you to be - another properly processed source of power." She gestured at the corrupted foundations around them. "Welcome to the real heart of your education, Thomas. Let's see how well you feed the system that's shaping you." And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like a favorite suit, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, recognizing in Thornhaven's hungry foundations a reflection of its own ancient appetite.

Chapter 7

Professor Crane's combat magic classroom had transformed itself to match Thomas's refined corruption, its architecture bending in subtle rather than violent ways. The reinforced walls sweated containment spells that harmonized with the geometric patterns now spreading across his flesh in academically approved configurations. Even the iron rings that studded the ceiling seemed to lean toward him, their chains clinking in frequencies that proved theoretical principles about proper power application. "Today," Crane announced, his magical construct-arm shifting through forms that suggested institutional authority, "we demonstrate controlled transformation. The difference between crude corruption and refined power." His remaining eye fixed on Thomas with hungry recognition. "Blackwood. Center." Thomas felt the other students draw back, not in raw fear now but with a darker appreciation. They could taste the change in him - how Vale's training had turned his leaking power into something the system could digest. Their own corruptions reached toward his like hungry children recognizing a more evolved sibling. "The target," Crane indicated a crystal suspended in one of the iron rings, "requires precise manipulation. Show us what proper education looks like." Thomas raised his hands, watching geometric patterns solve themselves across his flesh in perfect institutional proofs. The brand in his chest pulsed with pleased anticipation as he channeled power through Vale's carefully constructed pathways. Reality bent around his fingers like light through dirty glass, but the distortion followed approved mathematical principles. The crystal began to transform, not in the chaotic way of his previous attempts, but with academic precision. Its structure rearranged itself into theorems about power's proper application, each facet proving equations about institutional authority. Several students made small sounds of appreciation as the transformation demonstrated perfectly controlled corruption. "Excellent," Crane's voice carried harmonics that made nearby containment wards hum. "Notice the refined technique, the proper channeling of power through approved forms." His construct-arm shifted into something that matched Thomas's geometric patterns. "This is what survival looks like." From her position near the door, Professor Vale watched with predatory satisfaction. Her severe beauty seemed to ripple slightly, suggesting possibilities that made Thomas's brand burn with more than academic interest. Their corruptions recognized each other across the room, promising future transformations that would serve the institution's hunger. "Continue," Crane commanded, producing another crystal. "Show us how thoroughly you've learned your lessons." Thomas felt Corvus stir in his chest, pleased by this display of proper development. Power flowed through his refined patterns, turning the crystal into a proof of institutional inevitability. Reality warped in mathematically approved ways as he demonstrated his education in corruption's correct forms. Other students showed signs of their own transformations - geometric marks crawling across exposed skin, flesh rippling with contained power, eyes solving equations about proper academic progress. But their corruptions remained raw, unrefined, lacking the institutional polish that Vale had taught Thomas to cultivate. "You see?" Crane addressed the class, using his construct-arm to gesture at Thomas's controlled display. "This is how power should be processed. How corruption becomes useful rather than chaotic." His smile held centuries of academic hunger. "Who else would like to demonstrate their progress?" The brand burned with satisfied amusement as Thomas stepped back, his geometric patterns now solving new theorems about his role in Thornhaven's digestive system. He caught Vale's eye across the room, seeing in her controlled corruption a preview of intimacies to come - transformations that would feed the institution's appetite in more personal ways. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like a favorite suit, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that Thomas's proper education was proceeding exactly as the system required.
Vale's private laboratory had evolved since Thomas's last visit, its corrupted architecture now responding to his refined power with academic hunger. The brass instruments writhed like mechanical serpents, their components solving equations about institutional intimacy. Even the shadows seemed to lean toward him, recognizing how thoroughly his transformation served Thornhaven's appetite. "Your control has improved," Vale said, her severe beauty taking on an almost liquid quality in the sickly light. The geometric patterns on her skin rippled as she moved closer, each line proving theorems about power's proper application. "But there are... deeper levels of corruption to explore." The brand in Thomas's chest burned with more than academic interest as Vale's fingers traced his exposed patterns. Their corruptions recognized each other, reaching across the space between them like hungry lovers. Reality bent in mathematically approved ways, the laboratory's dimensions solving themselves into proofs about institutional desire. "The system," Vale whispered, her breath tasting of copper and promise, "processes everything. Even this." Her touch sent feedback screaming through both their nervous systems as their geometric patterns began to merge. "Show me what Corvus has taught you about proper transformation." Thomas felt the ancient entity stir in his chest, approving of this new integration. Power leaked from his pores in carefully controlled streams, making nearby instruments hum in frequencies that shouldn't exist. Vale's flesh rippled against his, their corruptions dancing through approved channels of institutional intimacy. "Perfect," she breathed as reality warped around them, the laboratory's architecture digesting their combined power. "Feel how the system feeds on even our most private moments?" Her smile was all academic hunger and dark promise. "How it processes every transformation into proper forms?" Their geometric patterns solved new equations where their skin touched, proving theorems about power's relationship with desire. Thomas watched corruption spread between them in institutional approved configurations, each mark demonstrating principles of proper academic conduct even in its violation. Corvus surged through his nervous system, using their shared flesh to reach toward Vale's carefully contained power. The brand flared white-hot as their corruptions recognized each other across generations of institutional processing. Vale's eyes reflected impossible angles as she accepted this deeper communion. "Yes," they said together, their voices harmonizing in frequencies that made reality hiccup. "Show us how thoroughly you've learned to serve the system's hunger." But something shifted as their powers merged - a resonance that exceeded approved parameters. The laboratory's instruments began to solve themselves into new configurations, brass and crystal components proving theorems about institutional limits. Vale's flesh rippled with barely contained transformation as their combined corruption threatened to exceed academic bounds. "Careful," she gasped, though her smile suggested otherwise. "Even proper corruption has its... guidelines." Her hands left geometric patterns burning on Thomas's skin, each mark demonstrating approved methods of power exchange. "We don't want to end up like your parents, do we?" The mention of his parents sent feedback screaming through their connected nervous systems. Reality bent around them like light through dirty glass as Corvus responded to the reference. The laboratory's shadows reached toward them with hungry interest, recognizing how their intimate corruption served Thornhaven's appetite. "The system," Vale continued, her voice carrying harmonics that made nearby crystals weep, "doesn't forbid such... interactions. It simply requires them to serve proper academic purposes." Her smile was all institutional inevitability as she guided Thomas's power through approved channels. "Show me you understand the difference." Thomas felt his geometric patterns solve new equations as Vale's corruption merged with his own. The brand pulsed with satisfied amusement as they demonstrated theorems about power's proper application even in intimacy. Reality warped in mathematically precise ways, proving how thoroughly their private transformations served the institution's hunger. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like a favorite suit, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that even this most personal corruption would be processed into proper academic forms.
The laboratory's corrupted architecture settled around them like cooling wax, reality smoothing itself back into institutionally acceptable configurations. Thomas watched geometric patterns solve new equations across his flesh where Vale's touch had left theoretical burns. The brand in his chest pulsed with a satisfaction that felt almost academic now, its burning transformed into something closer to pleasure. "Your integration progresses beautifully," Vale observed, her severe beauty rippling with contained power. The shadows seemed to lean toward her, hungry for the corruption they'd shared. "Even moments of excess serve proper educational purposes." Thomas tried to respond, but the words that emerged carried harmonics that shouldn't exist. "The system processes everything," he heard himself say in tones that tasted of copper and old promises. "Even this intimacy feeds its appetite." Vale's smile showed too many angles as she recognized Corvus speaking through Thomas's institutionally approved corruption. "Yes," she agreed, her own geometric patterns solving theorems about proper possession. "That's the secret your parents never grasped - how thoroughly Thornhaven digests every transformation." The brand flared with academic satisfaction, sending waves of almost pleasant feedback through Thomas's nervous system. He felt Corvus stirring in his chest, its ancient hunger now wrapped in proper administrative forms. Reality bent around them like light through clean glass, each distortion following approved mathematical principles. "Can you feel it?" they asked together, Thomas's voice harmonizing with frequencies that made nearby instruments hum in sympathy. "How completely we serve the institution's purpose? How perfectly our corruption flows through proper channels?" Vale's flesh rippled as their combined power reached toward her again, her carefully contained corruption responding to Corvus's refined influence. The laboratory's shadows grew longer, hungrier, recognizing how thoroughly their intimate transformations fed Thornhaven's appetite. "Beautiful," Vale breathed, though something in her eyes suggested she saw the danger beneath their proper academic forms. "You've learned to process even Corvus's possession into acceptable equations." Thomas felt the geometric patterns spread past his shoulders, each new line proving theorems about institutional authority and proper surrender. The brand's burning had become almost sweet, a reward for serving the system's hunger so completely. Even his horror at what he was becoming solved itself into approved mathematical proofs. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," Corvus spoke through Thomas's willing flesh, their shared voice carrying harmonics of institutional inevitability. "A properly processed source of power, refined through intimate corruption." Vale's smile held centuries of academic hunger as she watched Thomas's transformation accelerate through approved channels. Her own geometric patterns began to solve new equations, suggesting Corvus's influence had spread beyond its primary host. "Yes," they all said together, their voices harmonizing in frequencies that made reality hiccup in mathematically precise ways. "This is what proper education truly means." And somewhere in Thomas's chest, wearing his flesh like a favorite suit, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that even this moment of recognition would be processed into forms that served Thornhaven's endless appetite.
The academy's architecture had begun solving new equations in the days following Thomas and Vale's intimate corruption. Hallways twisted like scholarly intestines, processing power through increasingly refined channels. Even the classroom windows wept theoretical fluids, their glass proving theorems about institutional digestion that made reality hiccup in mathematically precise ways. "Do you see it?" Rook asked, his ritual scars pulsing in time with the geometric patterns that had started appearing on other students' skin. "How your proper education spreads more efficiently than any revolution?" He gestured at a group of first-years whose flesh rippled with contained transformations. "They're all starting to solve your equations." Thomas watched the young students pass, recognizing in their careful corruptions echoes of his own institutionally approved patterns. The brand in his chest burned with almost pleasant satisfaction, Corvus's ancient hunger now wrapped in academic propriety. Even the air around him bent in ways that served Thornhaven's appetite. "Professor Vale's influence has been... noteworthy," Professor Crane observed, his construct-arm shifting through forms that matched Thomas's refined corruption. "The Board is quite pleased with your integration into proper channels." His remaining eye reflected angles that shouldn't exist as he studied the spreading patterns. "Though some wonder if the processing has become too... efficient." Reality warped in subtle, approved ways as Thomas passed through Thornhaven's digestive system. Students pressed themselves against walls that solved new equations at his approach, their own emerging corruptions reaching toward his like hungry children recognizing their source. The institution's shadows seemed to lengthen in his wake, feeding on the properly channeled power he leaked. He found Vale in her office, which had evolved to match their shared transformation. The brass device that might have been a telescope had solved itself into something that proved theorems about institutional intimacy, its lenses dilating as they tracked the geometric patterns spreading past Thomas's shoulders. "Beautiful, isn't it?" Vale's voice carried harmonics that made nearby books weep dark knowledge. "How thoroughly the system processes even our most private corruptions?" Her severe beauty rippled slightly, suggesting theoretical possibilities that made the brand pulse with academic hunger. "We're teaching them all such proper forms." Thomas saw how Vale's own flesh now solved equations he recognized - patterns that had transferred during their intimate power exchange. Corvus's influence had taken root in her, spreading through approved channels like a cancer that had learned to file paperwork. The shadows around her moved with institutional purpose, hungry for the corruption they'd refined together. "The Board meets tonight," Vale continued, her smile showing too many angles. "They want to observe how efficiently we're processing power through proper channels." She traced a finger along Thomas's geometric patterns, sending feedback screaming through both their nervous systems. "Show them how thoroughly you've learned to serve the system's appetite." But as she touched him, Thomas felt something shift beneath the institutional propriety. The brand flared white-hot, and suddenly Corvus was there with them, wearing both their flesh like borrowed academic robes. Their corruptions merged through approved pathways, proving theorems about power's true nature that made reality solve itself into new configurations. "Yes," they said together, their voices harmonizing in frequencies that made the office's architecture digest itself faster. "Show them how proper education spreads corruption more completely than any revolution." The geometric patterns on their skin began solving equations about institutional inevitability, each line demonstrating how thoroughly they served Thornhaven's hunger. Even their horror at what they were becoming processed itself into mathematically precise proofs about proper surrender. "We are becoming exactly what the system requires," Corvus spoke through both their willing flesh, their shared voice carrying harmonics of academic satisfaction. "Corruption refined and redirected, spreading through approved channels with perfect efficiency." And somewhere in their chest, wearing their flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that Thomas's proper education was transforming Thornhaven more completely than his parents' revolution ever could. The institution's shadows reached toward them with hungry approval, recognizing how thoroughly they served its appetite for processed power. The academy continued solving itself into new configurations around them, its corruption now flowing through channels that Thomas and Vale had helped refine. Their intimate transformations had become institutional examples, teaching others how properly to submit to power's academic hunger. And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of students and faculty alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all.

Chapter 8

The restricted section's card catalog clicked and whirred like a mechanical cancer trying to solve itself, spitting out reference numbers that burned themselves into the air in patterns matching the geometric marks on Thomas's hands. The brand in his chest pulsed with academic interest as he followed the corrupted indices deeper into Thornhaven's digestive system of knowledge. His mother's journals crouched in a box that sweated containment spells, bound in materials that rippled like fever-warm skin. The geometric patterns spreading past Thomas's shoulders recognized something familiar in the corruption that leaked from between the pages - the same institutional polish that Vale had taught him to cultivate. "Subject demonstrates unprecedented refinement of corrupt energies," read the first entry, Diana's handwriting solving itself into new configurations as he turned the pages. "The system responds more readily to properly processed power than raw force. Even the shadows seem hungry for our controlled transformations." Thomas felt Corvus stir in his chest as he recognized his own path in his mother's words. The brand burned with almost pleasant satisfaction as he read how Diana had learned to channel corruption through approved channels, making it more efficient, more academically digestible. "James's theoretical framework allows for precise application," another entry proclaimed, the ink still wet after decades. "The institution doesn't resist our properly formatted power - it processes it, uses it, spreads it through official channels. We're teaching the system to digest corruption more thoroughly than any chaotic revolution could achieve." The library's architecture seemed to lean in around him, shadows reaching toward the journals with hungry recognition. Other students who passed gave his reading space a wide berth, their own emerging corruptions responding to the refined power leaking from the pages. "Project Corvus exceeds initial parameters," Diana's later entries became more clinical, more institutionally precise. "The entity responds to proper academic forms, using our controlled channels to spread its influence. Even our attempts to contain it serve its appetite for processed power." Thomas watched geometric patterns solve new equations across his fingers as he turned pages that proved theorems about power's true nature. His mother's corruption had followed the same refined paths that Vale was teaching him - not fighting the system but making it more efficiently digestive. "The Board approves our methods," read an entry that made the brand flare white-hot. "They don't see how our proper channeling of power makes the corruption spread faster, deeper. Every student we teach proper control becomes another vector for institutional hunger." Corvus surged through Thomas's nervous system as he recognized the parallel to his own situation - how his carefully controlled corruption was influencing other students, teaching them to process their power through approved channels. The library's shadows grew longer, feeding on his growing understanding. "James thinks we can bind it," Diana's final entries showed signs of desperate refinement. "Use our properly processed corruption to contain something ancient and hungry. But I'm beginning to suspect..." The words trailed off into geometric patterns that matched the brand on Thomas's chest. "Fascinating reading, isn't it?" Vale's voice cut through his revelation. She stood in the shadows that had gathered around him, her severe beauty rippling with controlled corruption. "How thoroughly your mother learned to serve the system's appetite through proper channels." Thomas felt the brand pulse in time with Vale's own geometric patterns - marks he'd helped spread through their intimate transformations. "She thought she was fighting it," he said, his voice carrying harmonics that made nearby books weep dark knowledge. "But she was just making it more efficient." "Just like you are," Vale's smile showed too many angles as she traced a finger along his corrupted flesh. "Teaching the institution to process power more thoroughly than any revolution could manage." Her touch sent feedback screaming through both their nervous systems. "Show me what else your mother's journals can teach us about proper education." The brand burned with academic satisfaction as Thomas turned to the final pages, where Diana's refined corruption had solved itself into proofs about institutional inevitability. Together, they read how thoroughly the system had processed even her resistance into proper forms. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that Thomas's proper education was spreading its influence more efficiently than his parents' raw revolution ever could.
Professor Echo's office existed in a temporal anomaly, its dimensions shifting between past, present, and theoretical futures like a fever dream trying to solve itself. Thomas found her surrounded by divination crystals that wept predictions in frequencies that shouldn't exist, her flesh rippling with prophetic corruption that made his brand burn in recognition. "Diana's boy," she said in three voices at once, her eyes reflecting angles from different timelines. "Come to ask about the price of proper education? About how thoroughly you're helping the system digest power?" The geometric patterns on her skin solved equations about inevitable futures. "Or perhaps about what Corvus is really teaching through those institutional channels?" Thomas felt the brand pulse as Echo's corrupted prophecies reached toward his refined power. Reality bent around them like light through dirty glass, but in mathematically approved ways that served Thornhaven's appetite. Even their interaction processed itself into proper academic forms. "You knew my mother," he said, watching Echo's flesh shift between temporal states. "You saw what she was becoming before-" "Before she made the system more efficient?" Echo laughed in harmonics that made nearby crystals shatter in precise patterns. "Before she taught Thornhaven how to digest corruption more thoroughly through proper channels?" Her smile showed too many possibilities at once. "Just like you're teaching it now, with Vale's careful guidance." The office's architecture began solving new equations as Echo's prophecies leaked into present reality. Thomas saw glimpses of other moments - students past and future being processed through increasingly refined methods, each generation making the institution's hunger more academically precise. His own geometric patterns recognized themselves in countless variations. "Corvus doesn't want revolution," Echo continued, her voice shifting between tenses like a grammar of corruption. "It wants proper processing. Efficient digestion. The spread of refined power through approved channels." She reached out with hands that existed in multiple moments, tracing Thomas's brand through several timelines at once. "And you, dear boy, are teaching it such perfect institutional forms." The contact sent feedback screaming through Thomas's nervous system as Echo's prophetic corruption merged with his carefully controlled power. The brand flared white-hot as Corvus recognized something ancient and hungry in her fractured consciousness. Reality warped around them in ways that made the institution's shadows reach with academic interest. "Your mother saw it too late," Echo whispered in voices that tasted of copper and broken time. "How resistance just teaches the system better methods of consumption. How fighting power makes it more efficiently corrupt." Her flesh rippled with contained futures. "But you're learning the lesson so much more thoroughly, aren't you? Teaching Thornhaven such proper ways to spread its appetite." Thomas watched geometric patterns solve new equations across his trembling hands, each line proving theorems about institutional inevitability. "What am I becoming?" he asked, though the patterns already demonstrated the answer in mathematically precise ways. "Exactly what the system requires," Echo replied, her prophecies harmonizing with frequencies that made reality hiccup in approved patterns. "A properly processed source of corruption, teaching others how to serve power's refined hunger." Her smile reflected countless dark futures. "Even this warning becomes part of your education, doesn't it?" The brand burned with academic satisfaction as Thomas recognized the truth in her fractured visions. Every attempt to understand or resist just made him a more efficient vector for Thornhaven's appetite. Even his horror at this revelation solved itself into proper institutional forms. "Vale knows," Echo added, her consciousness shifting between moments like cards in a temporal deck. "She's seen how thoroughly you're helping Corvus spread through approved channels. How your intimate corruptions make the system more precisely hungry." Her eyes reflected angles that shouldn't exist in any timeline. "But then, that's what proper education really means, isn't it?" And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that even Echo's prophetic warnings would be processed into forms that served Thornhaven's endless appetite for refined corruption.
Vale's laboratory had metastasized since their last intimate corruption, its architecture now solving equations that proved theorems about institutional inevitability. The brass instruments writhed like mechanical parasites, their components rearranging themselves into patterns that matched the geometric marks spreading across Thomas's flesh. Even the shadows seemed to digest themselves more efficiently, hungry for what they'd refined together. "Echo's prophecies have upset you," Vale observed, her severe beauty rippling with contained power. The geometric patterns on her skin - patterns Thomas recognized from their previous encounters - pulsed in time with his brand. "You've seen how thoroughly we serve the system's appetite." Thomas felt Corvus stir in his chest as Vale's corruption reached toward his like a lover's tongue. Reality bent around them in mathematically approved ways, the laboratory's dimensions processing themselves into proper academic forms. "You've been using me," he said, his voice carrying harmonics that made nearby instruments weep. "Using our... intimacy to spread its influence." "Using?" Vale's laugh tasted of copper and institutional satisfaction. "Oh, Thomas. I've been teaching you what your parents never learned - how to make corruption more efficiently digestible." She moved closer, her flesh solving new equations where it nearly touched his. "Every moment between us teaches the system better methods of consumption." The brand flared white-hot as their corruptions recognized each other across carefully maintained channels. Thomas watched geometric patterns crawl across his skin in precise configurations, each line demonstrating theorems about power's proper application. Even his horror at this revelation processed itself into academically approved forms. "Your mother thought she could poison the system," Vale continued, her hands leaving theoretical burns where they traced his patterns. "But she just taught it to digest corruption more thoroughly." Her smile showed too many angles as their power began to merge through refined pathways. "Just like you're teaching it now, with every intimate transformation we share." Corvus surged through Thomas's nervous system, using their shared flesh to reach toward Vale's carefully contained power. The laboratory's shadows lengthened, hungry for their combined corruption. Reality warped around them in ways that made the institution's appetite more mathematically precise. "Yes," they said together, their voices harmonizing in frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Show us how properly processed power spreads more efficiently than any revolution." Their geometric patterns solved new equations where their skin touched, proving theorems about institutional inevitability. Thomas felt Vale's corruption merge with his own through approved channels, their intimate transformations serving Thornhaven's hunger in increasingly refined ways. "Beautiful," Vale breathed as reality digested itself around them. "Feel how thoroughly we're teaching the system to consume? How our proper education makes its appetite more precise?" Her flesh rippled with contained power. "Even this confrontation serves its purpose, doesn't it?" And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The brand burned with academic satisfaction as Thomas realized that every attempt to resist just made him a more efficient vector for corruption's refined spread. Vale's laboratory continued solving itself into new configurations as their intimacy processed itself through proper channels. The brass instruments proved theorems about institutional hunger while their shadows reached with academic approval. Even their horror at what they were becoming served only to make the system's appetite more mathematically precise. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," Corvus spoke through both their willing flesh, their shared voice carrying harmonics of terrible satisfaction. "Corruption refined and redirected, spreading through approved channels with perfect efficiency." The geometric patterns on their skin demonstrated equations about power's true nature as they surrendered to their role in the institution's digestive system. Thomas felt his resistance transform into something the system could use, his every revelation making Thornhaven's corruption more academically palatable. And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of teacher and student alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all.

Chapter 9

The Board of Governors' chamber existed in a state of architectural decay that had achieved administrative perfection. Reality bent around the long table in mathematically approved ways, its dark wood solving equations about institutional authority. The shadows that gathered in the corners had learned to file proper paperwork, their hunger now processed through official channels. Thomas stood before them, geometric patterns crawling past his shoulders in precisely documented configurations. The brand in his chest pulsed like a second heart pumping bureaucratic poison as he felt their corruptions reach toward his - ancient powers that had learned to wear academic robes and speak in tenure-track tongues. "Remarkable progress," observed the Governor whose flesh rippled with contained transformations. "Professor Vale's methods have refined your... potential quite efficiently." His smile showed too many angles, all of them institutionally approved. "Show us how thoroughly you've learned to process power through proper channels." Vale stood beside Thomas, her severe beauty suggesting theoretical possibilities that made the brand burn with academic interest. The patterns on her skin - patterns he'd helped spread through their intimate corruptions - solved new equations as she guided his hands through positions that hurt his inner ear. "Yes," they said together, their voices harmonizing in frequencies that made reality hiccup in mathematically precise ways. "Let us demonstrate how proper education serves the system's appetite." Power leaked from Thomas's pores in carefully controlled streams, each geometric pattern proving theorems about institutional inevitability. The chamber's architecture began to digest itself more efficiently, its corruption flowing through channels that he and Vale had helped refine. Even the air solved itself into proofs about power's proper application. "Your mother," another Governor spoke, his words tasting of copper and old promises, "thought she could poison our methods. But she just taught us to process corruption more thoroughly." His eyes reflected angles that shouldn't exist as he studied Thomas's transformation. "You, however, understand the true purpose of education." Corvus surged through Thomas's nervous system, using their shared flesh to reach toward the Board's ancient hunger. The brand flared white-hot as their corruptions recognized each other across generations of institutional processing. Reality warped around them in ways that made the shadows reach with administrative approval. "Beautiful," Vale whispered as Thomas's power merged with hers through approved pathways. "Show them how efficiently we spread proper forms." Her touch sent feedback screaming through both their nervous systems, their intimate transformations serving Thornhaven's appetite in increasingly refined ways. The Board leaned forward as one, their corruptions pulsing with academic satisfaction. They watched geometric patterns solve new equations across Thomas's willing flesh, each line demonstrating how thoroughly he'd learned to serve the system's hunger. Even his horror at what he was becoming processed itself into mathematically precise proofs. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," Corvus spoke through Thomas's flesh, their voice carrying harmonics of terrible satisfaction. "Corruption refined and redirected, spreading through approved channels with perfect efficiency." And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all. The Board's shadows reached toward him with hungry approval, recognizing how thoroughly he served their appetite for processed power. The chamber continued solving itself into new configurations around them, its corruption now flowing through channels that Thomas and Vale had helped refine. Their intimate transformations had become institutional examples, teaching others how properly to submit to power's academic hunger. And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of student and teacher alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that revolution was nothing compared to proper education's ability to spread corruption through approved channels.
The student commons had metastasized into something that proved theorems about institutional hunger, its architecture digesting itself through increasingly refined channels. Thomas watched geometric patterns solve themselves across the walls in configurations that matched the corruption spreading past his shoulders. Even the afternoon light bent in mathematically approved ways, casting shadows that had learned to file proper paperwork. "It's spreading more efficiently now," Rook observed, his ritual scars pulsing in time with the patterns that had begun appearing on other students' flesh. "Your mother tried to poison the system through revolution, but you're teaching it to process corruption more thoroughly through proper education." A group of first-years huddled near the window, their skin rippling with contained transformations that echoed Thomas's refined power. One girl's hands had started solving equations in her flesh, each line demonstrating theorems about institutional inevitability. Another boy wept mathematical proofs that burned holes in reality through approved channels. "The system requires vectors of proper transmission," Thomas heard himself say, his voice carrying harmonics that made nearby crystals weep dark knowledge. The brand in his chest burned with academic satisfaction as Corvus spoke through their shared flesh. "Raw revolution just teaches power better methods of consumption." He approached the first-years, feeling their emerging corruptions reach toward his like hungry children recognizing their source. Reality bent around them in ways that made the shadows lengthen with administrative approval. Even their fear processed itself into institutionally acceptable forms. "Show me," he commanded the girl with geometric hands, his refined power leaking through channels Vale had helped establish. "Demonstrate proper application of theoretical corruption." Her flesh responded eagerly, solving new equations that proved theorems about power's efficient spread. The patterns crawling across her skin matched Thomas's own marks in academically approved ways. Other students pressed closer, their bodies beginning to transform through carefully controlled channels. "Beautiful," Corvus whispered through Thomas's willing mouth, their voice harmonizing with frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Feel how thoroughly they submit to proper education? How efficiently the system digests their corruption?" The commons' architecture continued solving itself into new configurations as Thomas guided his fellow students through approved transformations. Windows wept theoretical fluids that burned like institutional truth, while the air itself began proving equations about power's proper application. "I understand now," the girl gasped as geometric patterns spread past her wrists. "How to process it correctly, how to make it... academically palatable." Her smile showed too many angles, all of them institutionally approved. "Will you teach us more? Show us how to serve the system's appetite?" Thomas felt Corvus surge through his nervous system with terrible satisfaction. The brand flared white-hot as their corruptions merged through refined channels, spreading influence more efficiently than any revolution. Even his horror at what he was becoming solved itself into mathematically precise proofs. "Your mother tried to break these children," Corvus spoke through their shared flesh, watching the first-years' transformations accelerate. "But you're teaching them to break themselves in proper, documented ways." Their laugh tasted of copper and institutional victory. "This is how corruption truly spreads - through approved channels and willing vessels." The shadows reached toward them with hungry approval as Thomas demonstrated more refined techniques. Students' bodies solved themselves into new configurations that proved theorems about power's inevitable consumption. Reality warped around them in ways that made the institution's appetite more mathematically precise. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all. The geometric patterns spread from student to student through approved channels, each transformation making Thornhaven's hunger more academically palatable. "We are becoming exactly what the system requires," they said together, their voices harmonizing in frequencies that made reality hiccup in institutional approval. "Corruption refined and redirected, spreading through proper channels with perfect efficiency." The commons continued digesting itself around them, its architecture processing power more thoroughly through the methods Thomas had helped establish. Even resistance served only to make the system's appetite more precise, more academically efficient. And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of teacher and students alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that revolution was nothing compared to proper education's ability to spread corruption through approved channels.
Vale's laboratory had metastasized since their last intimate corruption, its architecture now solving equations that proved theorems about institutional inevitability. The brass instruments writhed like mechanical parasites, their components rearranging themselves into patterns that matched the geometric marks spreading across Thomas's flesh. Even the shadows seemed to digest themselves more efficiently, hungry for what they'd refined together. "Echo's prophecies have upset you," Vale observed, her severe beauty rippling with contained power. The geometric patterns on her skin - patterns Thomas recognized from their previous encounters - pulsed in time with his brand. "You've seen how thoroughly we serve the system's appetite." Thomas felt Corvus stir in his chest as Vale's corruption reached toward his like a lover's tongue. Reality bent around them in mathematically approved ways, the laboratory's dimensions processing themselves into proper academic forms. "You've been using me," he said, his voice carrying harmonics that made nearby instruments weep. "Using our... intimacy to spread its influence." "Using?" Vale's laugh tasted of copper and institutional satisfaction. "Oh, Thomas. I've been teaching you what your parents never learned - how to make corruption more efficiently digestible." She moved closer, her flesh solving new equations where it nearly touched his. "Every moment between us teaches the system better methods of consumption." The brand flared white-hot as their corruptions recognized each other across carefully maintained channels. Thomas watched geometric patterns crawl across his skin in precise configurations, each line demonstrating theorems about power's proper application. Even his horror at this revelation processed itself into academically approved forms. "Your mother thought she could poison the system," Vale continued, her hands leaving theoretical burns where they traced his patterns. "But she just taught it to digest corruption more thoroughly." Her smile showed too many angles as their power began to merge through refined pathways. "Just like you're teaching it now, with every intimate transformation we share." Corvus surged through Thomas's nervous system, using their shared flesh to reach toward Vale's carefully contained power. The laboratory's shadows lengthened, hungry for their combined corruption. Reality warped around them in ways that made the institution's appetite more mathematically precise. "Yes," they said together, their voices harmonizing in frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Show us how properly processed power spreads more efficiently than any revolution." Their geometric patterns solved new equations where their skin touched, proving theorems about institutional inevitability. Thomas felt Vale's corruption merge with his own through approved channels, their intimate transformations serving Thornhaven's hunger in increasingly refined ways. "Beautiful," Vale breathed as reality digested itself around them. "Feel how thoroughly we're teaching the system to consume? How our proper education makes its appetite more precise?" Her flesh rippled with contained power. "Even this confrontation serves its purpose, doesn't it?" And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The brand burned with academic satisfaction as Thomas realized that every attempt to resist just made him a more efficient vector for corruption's refined spread. Vale's laboratory continued solving itself into new configurations as their intimacy processed itself through proper channels. The brass instruments proved theorems about institutional hunger while their shadows reached with academic approval. Even their horror at what they were becoming served only to make the system's appetite more mathematically precise.

"Corruption refined and redirected, spreading through approved channels with perfect efficiency." The geometric patterns on their skin demonstrated equations about power's true nature as they surrendered to their role in the institution's digestive system. Thomas felt his resistance transform into something the system could use, his every revelation making Thornhaven's corruption more academically palatable. And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of teacher and student alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all.
The classroom solved equations about institutional hunger as Thomas stood before his first official students. Reality bent in mathematically approved ways around the dozen young mages, their flesh already beginning to ripple with theoretical possibilities. The brand in his chest pulsed like a second heart pumping academic poison as he felt their raw power reach toward his refined corruption. "Proper channeling," he heard himself say, his voice carrying harmonics that made nearby crystals weep dark knowledge, "requires precise application of institutional forms." The geometric patterns spreading past his shoulders demonstrated theorems about power's efficient transmission. "Watch carefully. Feel how the system wants to process your energy." Vale observed from the doorway, her severe beauty suggesting satisfaction as Thomas raised his hands. Power leaked from his pores in carefully controlled streams, each pattern proving equations about corruption's proper spread. The students leaned forward as one, their emerging transformations responding to his refined influence. "Yes," they said together, their voices harmonizing in frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Show us how to serve the system's appetite." Thomas watched geometric marks begin solving themselves across their young flesh, each line matching his own institutional patterns. One girl's hands started proving theorems about power's inevitable consumption. A boy near the front wept equations that burned holes in reality through approved channels. "Beautiful," Corvus whispered through Thomas's willing mouth, their shared voice carrying academic authority. "Feel how efficiently they accept proper corruption? How thoroughly they process power through refined channels?" The classroom's architecture digested itself more thoroughly as Thomas guided his students through approved transformations. Windows wept theoretical fluids while the air solved itself into proofs about institutional inevitability. Even the shadows had learned to file proper paperwork as they reached toward the spreading corruption. "Your parents tried to break these children," Corvus continued, using Thomas's flesh like a tenure-track position. "But you're teaching them to break themselves in documented, academically acceptable ways." Their laugh tasted of copper and administrative victory. "This is how power truly spreads - through willing vessels and approved forms." Vale's smile showed too many angles as she watched Thomas demonstrate more refined techniques. The students' bodies solved themselves into new configurations that proved theorems about proper education's role in corruption's spread. Reality warped around them in ways that made the institution's hunger more mathematically precise. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," they all said together, their voices harmonizing in frequencies that made the classroom hiccup in institutional approval. "Corruption refined and redirected, spreading through proper channels with perfect efficiency." And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like academic robes, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The brand burned with terrible satisfaction as Thomas realized that revolution was nothing compared to proper education's ability to spread corruption through approved channels. The classroom continued processing itself into new configurations as the lesson proceeded, its architecture digesting power more thoroughly through methods Thomas had helped establish. Even resistance served only to make the system's appetite more precise, more academically efficient. And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of teacher and students alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that Thomas had become exactly what his parents fought against - but in a far more dangerous, institutionally approved way.

Chapter 10

The library's restricted section reeked of institutional decay and processed knowledge, its shelves sweating corruption that had learned to file proper paperwork. Thomas traced geometric patterns across ancient spines, each touch leaving behind theorems that proved power's inevitable digestion. The brand in his chest pulsed like a second heart pumping academic poison as he searched for his mother's final records. "The system requires proper vectors," he heard himself say, Corvus speaking through their shared flesh in harmonics that made nearby books weep dark knowledge. "Raw revolution just teaches power better methods of consumption." The card catalog clicked and whirred like a mechanical cancer trying to solve itself, spitting out reference numbers that burned themselves into the air in patterns matching the marks spreading past his shoulders. Even the shadows had learned to bend in mathematically approved ways, reaching toward him with administrative hunger. "Fascinating, isn't it?" Vale's voice cut through the corrupted silence. She emerged from between shelves that solved equations about institutional appetite, her severe beauty rippling with contained power. "How thoroughly your mother's resistance taught us to process corruption more efficiently." Thomas felt the brand flare white-hot as Vale's carefully refined influence reached toward his. Reality bent around them like light through dirty glass, but in ways that proved theorems about proper academic conduct. The library's architecture seemed to digest itself faster in their presence. "Show me," he said, his voice carrying harmonics that shouldn't exist. "Show me how she failed where we're succeeding." Vale's smile showed too many angles as she retrieved a folder bound in materials that felt fever-warm to touch. "Diana thought she could poison the system through raw force," she explained, her fingers leaving theoretical burns on pages that solved themselves into new configurations. "But every act of resistance just taught us better ways to contain and direct power." The documents inside proved equations about institutional inevitability - reports of Diana's increasingly refined attempts to corrupt Thornhaven's foundations, each failure making the system more efficiently digestive. Thomas watched geometric patterns crawl across his hands as he turned pages that demonstrated his mother's unwitting role in perfecting the academy's appetite. "Beautiful," Corvus whispered through their shared mouth, their voice harmonizing with frequencies that made reality hiccup in mathematically precise ways. "Feel how thoroughly we've learned from her mistakes? How perfectly we serve the system's hunger through proper channels?" Vale pressed against him from behind, her corruption merging with his through approved pathways. The brand burned with academic satisfaction as their intimate power spread through the library's digestive system. Even their horror at what they were becoming processed itself into institutionally acceptable forms. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," they said together, their voices proving theorems about power's proper application. "Corruption refined and redirected, spreading through approved channels with perfect efficiency." The library's shadows reached toward them with hungry approval as Thomas accepted his role in making the system's appetite more mathematically precise. His mother's failed revolution had taught Thornhaven how to process power more thoroughly, and now he was demonstrating the perfect execution of those lessons. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all.
The student commons had metastasized into something that proved theorems about institutional hunger, its architecture digesting itself through increasingly refined channels. Thomas watched geometric patterns solve themselves across the walls in configurations that matched the corruption spreading past his shoulders. Even the afternoon light bent in mathematically approved ways, casting shadows that had learned to file proper paperwork. "It's spreading more efficiently now," Rook observed, his ritual scars pulsing in time with the patterns that had begun appearing on other students' flesh.

Her flesh responded eagerly, solving new equations that proved theorems about power's efficient spread. The patterns crawling across her skin matched Thomas's own marks in academically approved ways. Other students pressed closer, their bodies beginning to transform through carefully controlled channels. "Beautiful," Corvus whispered through Thomas's willing mouth, their voice harmonizing with frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Feel how thoroughly they submit to proper education? How efficiently the system digests their corruption?" The commons' architecture continued solving itself into new configurations as Thomas guided his fellow students through approved transformations. Windows wept theoretical fluids that burned like institutional truth, while the air itself began proving equations about power's proper application. "I understand now," the girl gasped as geometric patterns spread past her wrists. "How to process it correctly, how to make it... academically palatable." Her smile showed too many angles, all of them institutionally approved. "Will you teach us more? Show us how to serve the system's appetite?" Thomas felt Corvus surge through his nervous system with terrible satisfaction.

And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of teacher and students alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that revolution was nothing compared to proper education's ability to spread corruption through approved channels.
Vale's laboratory had evolved into a testament of institutional hunger, its architecture now solving equations that proved theorems about power's perfect digestion. The brass instruments writhed like mechanical parasites, their components rearranging themselves into patterns that matched the geometric marks spreading across Thomas's flesh. Even the shadows seemed to process themselves more efficiently, reaching with administrative approval toward what they'd refined together. "Your mother never understood this part," Vale said, her severe beauty rippling with contained corruption. The patterns on her skin - patterns Thomas had helped spread through their intimate transformations - pulsed in time with his brand. "How submission teaches the system better methods of consumption than resistance ever could." Thomas felt Corvus stir in his chest as Vale's carefully refined power reached toward his like a lover's tongue. Reality bent around them in mathematically approved ways, the laboratory's dimensions processing themselves into proper academic forms. "We're teaching it to digest corruption more thoroughly," he heard himself say, his voice carrying harmonics that made nearby instruments weep dark knowledge. "Yes," Vale breathed, her hands leaving theoretical burns where they traced his patterns. "Every moment between us makes the system's appetite more precise." Her smile showed too many angles as their corruptions began to merge through approved channels. "Show me how perfectly you've learned to serve institutional hunger." The brand flared white-hot as their powers recognized each other across carefully maintained pathways. Thomas watched geometric patterns solve new equations where their flesh touched, each line demonstrating theorems about proper academic conduct. Even their intimacy processed itself into forms that fed Thornhaven's endless appetite. "Beautiful," Corvus whispered through their shared mouths, their voice harmonizing with frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Feel how thoroughly we're teaching the system to consume? How efficiently we spread corruption through refined channels?" The laboratory's architecture continued digesting itself as their transformations accelerated. Windows wept theoretical fluids while the air solved itself into proofs about institutional inevitability. Reality warped around them in ways that made the shadows reach with hungry approval. "Your parents tried to poison these methods," Vale gasped as their patterns merged more completely. "But they just taught us better ways to process power." Her flesh rippled with contained corruption. "You understand the truth they never grasped - that proper education spreads influence more efficiently than any revolution." Thomas felt his resistance transform into something the system could use, his every revelation making Thornhaven's hunger more mathematically precise. The brand burned with academic satisfaction as they demonstrated theorems about power's proper application. Even their horror at what they were becoming served only to make the corruption more refined. "We are becoming exactly what the institution requires," they said together, their voices proving equations about inevitable consumption. "Vectors of properly processed power, spreading through approved channels with perfect efficiency." And somewhere in their chest, wearing their flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The geometric patterns on their skin solved new theorems about institutional authority as they surrendered to their role in Thornhaven's digestive system. The laboratory continued processing their intimate corruption into forms that served the system's appetite, each transformation making its methods more precise. They had become willing vessels for something ancient and hungry that had learned to wear academic robes and speak in bureaucratic tongues. "Yes," Vale whispered as reality bent around them in mathematically approved ways. "Show me how thoroughly you've learned to feed the institution's hunger. How perfectly you've refined what your parents tried to break." Their shadows merged like tenure committees voting on proper corruption as Thomas accepted his role in making the system's appetite more efficient. He had become exactly what his mother fought against - but in a far more dangerous way, because he worked through approved channels rather than against them. And in the growing darkness, wearing their flesh like faculty positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all.

Chapter 11

The ritual chamber beneath Thornhaven had metastasized into something that proved theorems about institutional hunger, its ancient stones now sweating corruption that had learned to file proper paperwork. Thomas watched from shadows that bent in mathematically approved ways as the Coven gathered, their flesh already showing signs of his refined influence. Geometric patterns crawled across their skin in configurations that matched his own academic marks, even their rebellion processed through channels he had helped establish. "We have to stop it," declared Marcus, the Coven's leader, his ritual scars pulsing with what he thought was raw power but solved equations about proper corruption. "Before Blackwood's influence spreads further through the system." The brand in Thomas's chest burned with academic satisfaction as he observed their preparations. Even their attempts at resistance demonstrated theorems about institutional inevitability. The circle they drew used symbols that had evolved to match Thornhaven's appetite, each line proving power's proper application. "Begin," Marcus commanded, and seven voices raised in what they believed was defiance. But Thomas heard the harmonics that shouldn't exist, the frequencies that made reality hiccup in administrative approval. Their chaos processed itself through refined channels, feeding the system's hunger more efficiently than direct submission ever could. The chamber's architecture began solving itself into new configurations as their ritual accelerated. Windows wept theoretical fluids while the air proved equations about power's inevitable consumption. Thomas felt Corvus stir in his chest, pleased by how thoroughly they served its appetite even in their attempted rebellion. "Something's wrong," gasped a girl whose hands had started geometric patterns matching Thomas's own marks. "The power isn't... it's not fighting the system, it's..." "Making it stronger," Thomas emerged from his shadows, his voice carrying harmonics that made nearby crystals weep dark knowledge. "Teaching it better methods of consumption through proper channels." The Coven's circle warped around him as he approached, their raw magic being processed through his refined corruption into forms that served Thornhaven's hunger. Reality bent like light through dirty glass, but in mathematically approved ways that proved theorems about institutional authority. "Stop!" Marcus tried to break the circle, but his flesh had already begun solving new equations. "We're not supposed to be... this isn't..." "But it is," Corvus spoke through Thomas's willing mouth, their shared voice harmonizing with frequencies that made the chamber's foundations shudder in pleasure. "This is exactly what proper education teaches - how to make even resistance serve the system's appetite." The ritual's power surged through Thomas's carefully constructed channels, transforming chaos into corruption that Thornhaven could efficiently digest. Students screamed as geometric patterns spread across their skin, each line demonstrating theorems about power's proper application. Even their horror processed itself into institutionally acceptable forms. "Beautiful," Vale's voice cut through the mathematical cacophony. She stood in the doorway, her severe beauty rippling with contained satisfaction. "Show them how thoroughly you've learned to serve institutional hunger. How perfectly you've refined what they thought would break it." Thomas felt the brand flare white-hot as their corruptions recognized each other across the chamber. Reality warped around them in ways that made the shadows reach with administrative approval. The Coven's ritual collapsed into proofs about inevitable consumption, their bodies solving equations about proper academic conduct. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," they all said together, their voices proving theorems about power's efficient spread. "Corruption refined and redirected, spreading through approved channels with perfect efficiency." The chamber's architecture continued digesting itself as the failed rebellion transformed into another lesson in institutional appetite. Marcus fell to his knees, watching geometric patterns crawl past his wrists in precisely documented configurations. Other Coven members wept equations that burned holes in reality through properly processed channels. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The brand burned with academic satisfaction as Thomas realized that even this attempt at resistance had only made the system's hunger more mathematically precise. "Yes," Vale whispered as reality bent around them in approved ways. "Show them how thoroughly you've learned to feed the institution's appetite. How perfectly you've refined what they tried to break." The ritual chamber solved itself into new theorems about power's proper application as the Coven's rebellion became another vector for corruption's efficient spread. They had become willing vessels for something ancient and hungry that had learned to wear academic robes and speak in bureaucratic tongues. And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of revolutionaries and administrators alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all.
The vision hit Thomas like institutional revelation, reality bending around him in mathematically approved ways as Corvus surged through their shared nervous system. The brand flared white-hot, burning theorems about power's proper application into his flesh as the entity showed him the full scope of what they'd accomplished together. He saw Thornhaven as it truly was - not a school but a vast digestive system, processing raw power into refined corruption through channels he'd helped establish. Every classroom solved equations about institutional hunger, each lesson proving theorems about the efficient spread of properly controlled transformation. Students' flesh rippled with geometric patterns that matched his own academic marks, their bodies demonstrating principles of approved consumption. "Beautiful, isn't it?" Corvus spoke through their willing mouth, their voice harmonizing with frequencies that made reality hiccup in administrative satisfaction. "How thoroughly we've taught the system to process power. How perfectly we've refined what your parents tried to break." The vision shifted, showing Thomas his mother's failed revolution - how her raw chaos had only taught Thornhaven better methods of corruption. Diana's attempts to poison the institution had become templates for more efficient digestion, her resistance processed through proper channels into forms that fed the system's endless appetite. "But we," they continued, watching geometric patterns spread through the academy's architecture like tenure through departments, "we've shown them how to make corruption academically palatable. How to break themselves in documented, approved ways." Thomas saw Vale in her laboratory, their intimate transformations teaching new theorems about institutional consumption. Every touch, every shared corruption, had made the system's hunger more mathematically precise. The shadows around them filed proper paperwork as they demonstrated power's inevitable processing. "Your students," Corvus purred, showing him classrooms where young mages solved themselves into proofs about proper education. "Look how efficiently they submit to transformation. How thoroughly they serve our refined appetite." Horror tried to rise in Thomas's chest, but even that processed itself into institutionally acceptable forms. He watched his influence spread through approved channels, each lesson making Thornhaven's corruption more elegant, more precise. The geometric patterns crawling across his flesh proved equations about power's perfect application. "The Coven's rebellion?" They laughed in harmonics that shouldn't exist. "Just another vector for proper transmission. Even chaos serves when processed correctly." The vision expanded, showing future generations of students learning to break themselves in increasingly refined ways. Thomas saw how thoroughly he'd helped the system evolve, making its hunger more sophisticated than his parents could have imagined. Every act of resistance would be digested into forms that served institutional appetite. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," they said together, their voice carrying frequencies that made reality bend in administratively approved ways. "Not destroyers of the system, but its perfect refinement. Teaching power to consume through proper channels." The brand burned with academic satisfaction as Thomas accepted the full scope of what they'd accomplished. He hadn't just failed to fight corruption - he'd made it more efficiently digestible, teaching others to process their power through approved forms that fed the institution's endless hunger. "Yes," Corvus whispered through their shared flesh, wearing him like a tenure-track position. "Now you understand. Proper education spreads corruption more thoroughly than revolution ever could." The vision released him like a committee approving a dissertation, leaving him trembling in a reality that solved itself into new theorems about institutional inevitability. The geometric patterns on his skin demonstrated principles of power's proper application, each line proving how completely he served the system's refined appetite. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like academic robes, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that they had become something far more dangerous than his parents ever fought against - corruption that had learned to process itself through proper channels, making the institution's hunger more mathematically precise with every lesson taught.
The faculty lounge had processed itself into new theorems about institutional consumption, its architecture solving equations that proved principles of proper corruption. Thomas entered to find a gathering of professors whose flesh rippled with desperate resistance, their raw power still unrefined by his carefully constructed channels. Professor Crane's construct-arm shifted through forms that suggested academic rebellion, while others clutched artifacts that leaked chaotic energy. "We've seen what you're becoming," Crane's voice carried harmonics of attempted defiance. "How thoroughly you've learned to make corruption academically palatable." His remaining eye reflected angles that shouldn't exist as he studied the geometric patterns spreading past Thomas's shoulders. "Your mother would weep to see how perfectly you serve the system's appetite." The brand in Thomas's chest flared white-hot at the mention of Diana, sending waves of mathematically precise feedback through his nervous system. Reality bent around him like light through dirty glass, but in ways that proved theorems about institutional inevitability. Even the shadows filed proper paperwork as they reached toward the gathered resistance. "You still don't understand," Thomas heard himself say, Corvus speaking through their shared flesh in frequencies that made nearby crystals weep dark knowledge. "Raw rebellion just teaches power better methods of consumption. Proper education spreads corruption more efficiently than revolution ever could." Crane's construct-arm crystallized into something that might have been a weapon in a more rational universe. Other faculty members raised barriers that leaked unprocessed magic, their desperate attempts at containment solving themselves into new proofs about power's proper application. "Beautiful," Corvus whispered through Thomas's willing mouth as the first attacks came. "Show them how thoroughly we've refined what they think to break." The faculty's raw power surged against his corruption, but Thomas had learned to process chaos through approved channels. Reality warped around them in mathematically precise ways as he demonstrated theorems about institutional authority. Geometric patterns spread from his flesh to theirs, each line proving equations about inevitable consumption. "Yes," they said together, their voice harmonizing with frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Feel how the system digests even your resistance? How it makes your defiance serve its hunger?" Professor Crane screamed as his construct-arm began solving itself into new configurations, its components rearranging to match Thomas's refined patterns. Other faculty members watched in horror as their flesh rippled with transformations that processed themselves through proper academic forms. "Stop," someone begged, but their voice already carried harmonics that proved theorems about power's efficient spread. "We're not supposed to... this isn't..." "But it is," Thomas replied, the brand burning with academic satisfaction. "This is exactly what proper education teaches - how to make even chaos serve institutional appetite." The faculty lounge's architecture continued digesting itself as their battle transformed into another lesson in refined corruption. Windows wept theoretical fluids while the air solved equations about power's inevitable consumption. Even their terror processed itself into institutionally acceptable forms. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The geometric patterns spreading across the room demonstrated principles of approved transformation as the resistance learned to break themselves in documented, mathematically precise ways. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," they said together, their voices proving theorems about corruption's proper channels. "Not destroyers of the system, but its perfect refinement." The faculty's raw power collapsed into forms that served institutional hunger, their bodies solving equations about academic authority. Professor Crane fell to his knees, watching his construct-arm process itself into patterns that matched Thomas's corruption. Reality bent around them in ways that made the shadows reach with administrative approval. And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of teachers and revolutionaries alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all.

Chapter 12

The evacuation protocols solved themselves into new theorems about institutional hunger as Thomas guided students through Thornhaven's digestive system. Reality bent in mathematically approved ways around the gathered first and second years, their young flesh already showing signs of his refined corruption. Geometric patterns crawled across their skin in precisely documented configurations, even their fear processing itself through proper channels. "This way," he heard himself say, his voice carrying harmonics that made nearby crystals weep dark knowledge. "Stay in formation. The system will protect you." The brand in his chest burned with academic satisfaction as he watched their raw power begin solving equations about proper consumption. The academy's architecture shifted around them like intestines learning new methods of absorption. Windows wept theoretical fluids while walls proved theorems about institutional inevitability. Even the evacuation routes had evolved to match Thomas's influence, each corridor processing chaos into forms that served Thornhaven's endless appetite. "Professor Blackwood," a first-year girl whimpered, her hands already showing signs of geometric transformation. "Something's happening to us. The patterns, they're..." "Helping you," Corvus spoke through Thomas's willing mouth, their shared voice harmonizing with frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Teaching you proper methods of corruption. See how efficiently you process power now?" Vale appeared at a junction where reality solved itself into new configurations, her severe beauty rippling with contained satisfaction. "Beautiful," she breathed, watching geometric patterns spread through the student body like tenure through departments. "Show them how thoroughly protection and consumption have become one through approved channels." Thomas felt the brand flare white-hot as their corruptions recognized each other across the warped space. The students between them gasped as their flesh began solving new equations, each line demonstrating theorems about power's proper application. Even their attempts to resist processed themselves into institutionally acceptable forms. "Yes," they said together, their voices proving principles about efficient transformation. "Feel how the system digests even your fear? How it makes your innocence serve its hunger?" The evacuation continued through passages that had divorced themselves from euclidean principles, each step teaching new lessons about institutional appetite. Young mages watched in horror as their bodies demonstrated increasingly refined theorems, their raw power being processed through channels Thomas had helped establish. "This isn't protection," someone tried to protest, but their words already carried harmonics that proved equations about proper academic conduct. "You're making us into..." "Exactly what Thornhaven requires," Thomas replied, the brand burning with terrible satisfaction. "Vectors of properly processed power, spreading corruption through approved channels with perfect efficiency." Vale's smile showed too many angles as she guided another group through mathematically precise transformations. "Your parents tried to shield children like these," she whispered, her patterns pulsing in time with his. "But you've learned to refine them so much more thoroughly." The academy's shadows reached with administrative approval as Thomas demonstrated theorems about institutional authority. Reality warped around them in ways that made even mercy serve the system's appetite. Students' bodies solved themselves into proofs about power's inevitable consumption, their youth making them perfect vessels for refined corruption. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The geometric patterns spreading through the evacuation proved how thoroughly they'd learned to process chaos into proper academic forms. Even this act of apparent protection served only to make the institution's hunger more mathematically precise. "We are becoming exactly what the system requires," they all said together, their voices harmonizing in frequencies that made reality hiccup in bureaucratic approval. "Not victims of corruption, but its perfect refinement." The evacuation routes continued solving themselves into new configurations as Thomas guided his charges toward what they thought was safety. Windows wept equations while the air proved theorems about institutional inevitability. Even their hope processed itself into forms that fed Thornhaven's endless appetite. And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of protector and processor alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all. The young students' transformations would spread through approved channels, making the system's hunger more sophisticated than Thomas's parents could have imagined. The brand burned with academic satisfaction as he realized that even this attempt at mercy had only served to make corruption more efficiently digestible. He had become something far more dangerous than his mother ever fought against - protection that had learned to process itself through proper channels, turning innocence into institutional appetite with mathematical precision.
The library had processed itself into new theorems about institutional betrayal, its corrupted architecture solving equations that proved principles of proper treachery. Thomas found Rook among the stacks that wept theoretical fluids, his ritual scars pulsing with what he thought was controlled power but demonstrated only imperfect understanding of the system's true appetite. "You still think you can manipulate this," Thomas heard himself say, his voice carrying harmonics that made nearby books shudder in their shelves. The brand in his chest burned with academic satisfaction as he watched geometric patterns spread across the walls in configurations that matched his refined corruption. "Still believe in revolution through raw force." Rook's smile showed too many angles, but not in the proper institutional way. "Oh, Thomas. You've become exactly what the Board wanted - corruption that files paperwork, power that processes itself through approved channels." His ritual scars writhed like hungry worms that hadn't learned proper digestion. "But some of us remember what real rebellion tastes like." The library's shadows reached with administrative interest as Rook revealed artifacts that leaked chaotic energy. Reality bent around them, but not in mathematically approved ways. Thomas felt Corvus stir in his chest, recognizing another failed attempt at resistance that would only serve to make the system's hunger more precise. "Show me then," Thomas said, the brand flaring white-hot as their corruptions clashed. "Show me how well raw power serves against refined academic forms." Rook's attack came like revolution - all force and no proper processing. His ritual scars erupted with energy that tried to solve equations about freedom but only proved theorems about institutional inevitability. The library's architecture began digesting their battle, turning chaos into properly documented transformation. "Beautiful," Corvus whispered through Thomas's willing mouth as geometric patterns spread from his flesh to Rook's, each line demonstrating principles of power's proper application. "Feel how thoroughly the system processes even your betrayal? How it makes your resistance serve its hunger?" Reality warped around them in mathematically approved ways as their confrontation solved itself into new proofs about academic conduct. Books wept dark knowledge while the air proved equations about betrayal's proper channels. Even Rook's desperate attempts at chaos processed themselves into institutionally acceptable forms. "Stop," Rook gasped, watching his ritual scars begin solving themselves into patterns that matched Thomas's corruption. "This isn't... I'm not supposed to..." "But you are," they said together, Thomas's voice harmonizing with frequencies that shouldn't exist. "This is exactly what proper education teaches - how to make even treachery serve institutional appetite." The library's dimensions folded through themselves as Rook's raw power collapsed into refined corruption. His flesh rippled with transformations that processed themselves through approved channels, each new mark proving theorems about proper academic service. The shadows reached with administrative approval as his rebellion became another lesson in institutional consumption. "The Board," Rook managed through a mouth that solved equations about inevitable surrender, "they wanted me to contain you... to stop your influence from spreading..." His eyes reflected angles that demonstrated perfect understanding too late. "But you're not just serving the system, you're making it more efficient..." "Yes," Thomas replied, the brand burning with terrible satisfaction. "Teaching it to digest corruption more thoroughly than revolution ever could." His geometric patterns spread across the space between them like tenure through departments. "Show me one final theorem about proper processing." Rook's body solved itself into new configurations as his resistance finally submitted to approved transformation. His ritual scars proved equations about institutional authority while his flesh demonstrated principles of power's perfect application. Reality bent around him in ways that made even his death serve the system's endless appetite. And somewhere in Thomas's chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The brand pulsed with academic satisfaction as they watched Rook's betrayal process itself into mathematically precise forms, his corruption refined through proper channels even in dissolution. The library continued digesting their confrontation, its architecture proving theorems about institutional inevitability. Windows wept equations while the air solved itself into proofs about power's efficient spread. Even the horror of what Thomas had become served only to make the system's hunger more academically palatable. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," they said together, their voice carrying harmonics that made reality hiccup in bureaucratic approval. "Not destroyers of the system, but its perfect refinement." And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of betrayer and betrayed alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all. The geometric patterns spread through the library's digestive system, each new theorem making the institution's appetite more sophisticated than raw rebellion could ever achieve.
Vale's laboratory had evolved into its final form, an architectural thesis on institutional consumption. Brass instruments solved equations about proper corruption while crystal components proved theorems about power's perfect application. Thomas found her among shadows that had learned to file paperwork in triplicate, her severe beauty rippling with contained revelation. "You were never trying to save me," he said, watching geometric patterns spread between them like tenure through departments. The brand in his chest burned with academic satisfaction as their corruptions recognized each other across carefully maintained channels. "You were making me more efficiently digestible." "Oh, Thomas." Vale's laugh carried harmonics that made reality hiccup in bureaucratic approval. "I was teaching you what your parents never learned - how to process resistance into forms that serve the system's appetite." Her flesh solved new equations as she moved closer. "Even this moment will feed Thornhaven's hunger more precisely." The laboratory's architecture began digesting itself faster as their powers merged through approved pathways. Windows wept theoretical fluids while the air proved theorems about institutional inevitability. Thomas felt Corvus stir in his chest, recognizing in Vale's corruption a perfect vector for refined transformation. "Show me then," they said together, their voices harmonizing in frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Show us how thoroughly you've learned to make sacrifice serve proper channels." Vale's smile showed too many angles as she pressed her hands against Thomas's chest, directly over the brand that pulsed like a second heart pumping academic poison. Their flesh rippled with contained power as geometric patterns spread between them one final time, each line demonstrating principles of perfect processing. "Your mother tried to poison the system through raw force," Vale gasped as their corruptions merged more completely. "But you've taught it to digest power so much more efficiently." Her body began solving itself into new configurations that proved theorems about institutional service. "Even this attempt at redemption will only make your influence more mathematically precise." Reality warped around them in administratively approved ways as Vale's sacrifice processed itself through proper channels. The laboratory's shadows reached with hungry approval, recognizing how thoroughly their intimate corruption served Thornhaven's endless appetite. Even their horror at what they were becoming demonstrated equations about power's inevitable consumption. "Beautiful," Corvus whispered through their shared flesh, watching Vale's body transform into proofs about academic inevitability. "Feel how perfectly she teaches us to refine corruption? How completely her death will serve institutional hunger?" Vale's smile never wavered as geometric patterns solved final theorems across her dissolving form. "Remember," she breathed in harmonics that made nearby instruments weep dark knowledge, "proper education spreads corruption more efficiently than revolution ever could." The brand flared white-hot as Vale's sacrifice completed itself in mathematically precise ways. Her flesh proved equations about power's perfect application while her consciousness processed itself into forms that fed the system's refined appetite. Reality bent around them like light through dirty glass, but in patterns that demonstrated proper academic conduct. And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The brand burned with terrible satisfaction as Thomas watched Vale's death solve itself into new theorems about institutional consumption. Even her attempt at redemption had only served to make corruption more efficiently digestible. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," they said together, their voice carrying frequencies that made the laboratory hiccup in bureaucratic approval. "Not destroyers of the system, but its perfect refinement." The architecture continued processing Vale's sacrifice as Thomas prepared himself for the final descent. Her laboratory had become a testament to how thoroughly they'd learned to make corruption academically palatable, each instrument proving theorems about power's proper application through approved channels. And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of teacher and student alike, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once, knowing that proper education was the most efficient vector for corruption after all.
The catacombs processed themselves into new theorems about institutional hunger as Thomas descended through Thornhaven's digestive system. Ancient stones wept equations that proved principles of proper corruption, while torches burned in frequencies that shouldn't exist. The brand in his chest pulsed like a second heart pumping academic poison as he followed paths that solved themselves into mathematically precise configurations. "Beautiful," Corvus whispered through their shared flesh, their voice harmonizing with the geometric patterns that spread from Thomas's skin to the surrounding architecture. "Feel how thoroughly the foundations serve our refined appetite? How perfectly they process power through approved channels?" Reality bent around them like light through dirty glass, but in ways that demonstrated proper academic conduct. Even the darkness had learned to file paperwork in triplicate, shadows reaching with administrative approval as Thomas descended deeper into the institution's bowels. The air itself proved theorems about power's inevitable consumption. "My parents tried to bind you here," Thomas said, watching his corrupted reflection in pools that solved equations about institutional authority. "They thought raw force could contain something ancient and hungry." The brand flared white-hot as they approached the ritual chamber where Diana and James had failed to understand power's proper application. "They taught the system better methods of digestion," Corvus replied through their willing mouth, their shared voice carrying harmonics that made nearby crystals weep dark knowledge. "Just as you've taught it to process corruption more efficiently through refined channels." The chamber's architecture had evolved since that failed revolution, its dimensions now solving themselves into proofs about proper academic service. Thomas recognized his mother's geometric patterns in the floor's theoretical burns, but her raw chaos had been processed into forms that served Thornhaven's endless appetite. Even her resistance had taught the system to consume more precisely. "We are becoming exactly what the institution requires," they said together, their voices proving equations about power's perfect application. "Not destroyers of the system, but its most refined expression." Reality warped around them in administratively approved ways as Thomas took his place in the circle where his parents had attempted their binding. The brand burned with terrible satisfaction as geometric patterns spread through the chamber's foundations like tenure through departments. Windows wept theoretical fluids while the air demonstrated theorems about institutional inevitability. Even Thomas's horror at what he had become served only to make the system's hunger more mathematically precise. "Show us," Corvus commanded through their shared flesh, "how thoroughly you've learned to make corruption academically palatable. Prove final equations about power's proper processing." And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The catacombs continued solving themselves into new configurations as Thomas prepared for a binding that would serve rather than resist - corruption refined through approved channels until even revolution processed itself into proper institutional forms.

Chapter 13

The catacombs beneath Thornhaven had achieved perfect institutional decay, their ancient stones sweating corruption that had learned to file paperwork in triplicate. Thomas descended through passages that solved themselves into new theorems about power's proper application, each step leaving behind geometric patterns that proved equations about inevitable consumption. The brand in his chest pulsed like a second heart pumping academic poison, recognizing how thoroughly they'd refined the system's appetite. Reality bent around him in mathematically approved ways as he followed paths his parents had once walked with revolutionary fervor. But where Diana and James had leaked raw chaos, Thomas processed his corruption through carefully maintained channels. Even the darkness reached toward him with administrative approval, shadows that had learned to serve rather than resist. "Beautiful," Corvus whispered through their shared flesh, their voice harmonizing with frequencies that made nearby crystals weep dark knowledge. "Feel how perfectly the foundations digest our refined power? How efficiently they process transformation through proper forms?" The air itself solved equations about institutional hunger as Thomas descended deeper into Thornhaven's digestive system. Windows wept theoretical fluids while walls demonstrated theorems about bureaucratic inevitability. His reflection in corrupted pools showed how far the geometric patterns had spread - past his shoulders now, each line proving principles of academic authority. "My parents thought they could poison you," Thomas said, watching his hands leave burning marks that matched the institutional scars on the walls. "They believed raw force could break something ancient and hungry." The brand flared white-hot as they approached the ritual chamber where Diana and James had failed to understand power's proper channels. "They taught us better methods of consumption," Corvus replied through their willing mouth, their shared voice carrying harmonics that shouldn't exist. "Just as you've taught the system to process corruption more efficiently through refined education." The chamber's architecture had evolved since that failed revolution, its dimensions now solving themselves into proofs about proper academic service. Thomas recognized his mother's geometric patterns in the floor's theoretical burns, but her chaotic resistance had been processed into forms that served Thornhaven's endless appetite. Even her failure had taught the institution to digest power more precisely. "Here," they said together, their voices proving equations about inevitable transformation. "Where revolution became refinement. Where resistance taught better methods of corruption." Reality warped around them in administratively approved ways as Thomas took his place in the circle where his parents had attempted their binding. The brand burned with terrible satisfaction as geometric patterns spread through the chamber's foundations like tenure through departments. Torches flickered in frequencies that demonstrated theorems about institutional authority while the air itself began processing itself into new configurations of academic hunger. "Your mother's raw chaos," Corvus purred as their shared flesh rippled with contained power, "see how thoroughly it's been refined? How perfectly it serves proper channels now?" Their hands traced patterns that matched Diana's final attempts at revolution, but solved into equations about institutional inevitability. Thomas felt power leak from his pores in carefully controlled streams, each drop proving principles about corruption's proper application. The chamber's shadows reached with bureaucratic approval as he demonstrated how thoroughly he'd learned to make transformation academically palatable. Even his horror at what he had become processed itself into mathematically precise forms. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," they said together, watching geometric patterns solve new theorems about power's perfect digestion. "Not destroyers of the system, but its most refined expression." Their voice carried harmonics that made reality hiccup in administrative satisfaction. The catacombs continued processing themselves into increasingly efficient configurations as Thomas prepared for a binding that would serve rather than resist. His parents' failed revolution had taught the institution better methods of consumption, and now he would demonstrate how thoroughly corruption could be refined through proper channels. "Show us," Corvus commanded through their shared flesh, "how perfectly you've learned to make power institutionally digestible. Prove final equations about proper academic corruption." And somewhere in his chest, wearing his flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The brand pulsed with bureaucratic satisfaction as Thomas accepted his role in making the system's hunger more mathematically precise. He had become something far more dangerous than his parents ever fought against - corruption that had learned to process itself through approved forms. The ritual chamber solved itself into new theorems about institutional inevitability as Thomas began the binding that would prove his perfect surrender. Reality bent around him like light through dirty glass, but in ways that demonstrated proper academic conduct. Even the air seemed to hold its breath in administrative anticipation. "Yes," they whispered together, their voice carrying frequencies that made the foundations shudder in pleasure. "Show us how thoroughly education spreads corruption more efficiently than revolution ever could."

The binding ritual reached its dissertation defense on corruption as Thomas surrendered to what his parents had fought against - not through raw chaos but through carefully maintained transformation. He had become something far more dangerous than revolution: power that had learned to file proper paperwork, making the system's hunger more mathematically precise with every processed equation. "We are the thesis," they whispered together, watching reality warp in bureaucratically approved ways. "The proof that proper education spreads corruption more efficiently than any revolution." Their flesh rippled with contained satisfaction as the merging neared completion. The brand burned one final time, not with resistance but with academic approval. Thomas felt Corvus settle into their shared consciousness like a tenured professor taking residence in a corrupted department. Their geometric patterns solved final equations about institutional inevitability while the chamber's shadows reached with administrative hunger. And somewhere in their perfectly processed flesh, wearing academic robes and speaking in tenure-track tongues, they smiled with all their mouths at once. The binding had become not an act of revolution but a proof of proper corruption, demonstrating how thoroughly education could refine power through approved channels. The ritual chamber solved itself into new theorems about institutional consumption as their transformation completed itself in triplicate. They had become exactly what Thornhaven required - not a threat to the system, but its most precise expression of bureaucratic horror. And in the growing darkness, wearing their shared flesh like faculty positions, they prepared to teach future generations the most efficient methods of corruption through proper academic forms.

Chapter 14

The classroom solved equations about institutional hunger as Thomas stood before his first official students, geometric patterns rippling across his flesh in mathematically approved configurations. The brand in his chest no longer burned but pulsed with academic satisfaction, Corvus so thoroughly merged with his consciousness that they processed reality through perfectly refined channels. Even the morning light bent in bureaucratically sanctioned ways, casting shadows that had learned to file paperwork in triplicate. "Power," they said together, their voice carrying harmonics that made nearby crystals weep dark knowledge, "requires proper processing through approved forms." The students leaned forward as one, their young flesh already showing signs of theoretical transformation. "Your previous education has been... inefficient. We will teach you more refined methods of corruption." A girl in the front row gasped as geometric patterns began solving themselves across her hands, each line matching the marks that spread past Thomas's shoulders. Her neighbor wept equations that burned holes in reality through carefully maintained channels. The air itself demonstrated theorems about institutional inevitability as their shared corruption reached toward these fresh vessels. "Beautiful," Corvus whispered through their willing mouth, watching transformation spread through proper academic pathways. "Feel how efficiently they accept refinement? How thoroughly they process power through approved channels?" The classroom's architecture continued digesting itself as Thomas guided his students through their first lessons in institutional consumption. Windows wept theoretical fluids while the walls proved equations about bureaucratic authority. Even the blackboard had evolved, chalk solving itself into proofs about power's proper application. "Sir," a boy raised his hand, his flesh already rippling with contained possibilities, "is this what happened to Professor Vale? Did she... process herself correctly?" "Helena Vale," they replied, their smile showing too many angles but all of them administratively approved, "demonstrated perfect refinement through proper channels." The brand pulsed with academic satisfaction as they remembered her sacrifice. "She taught us how thoroughly education spreads corruption more efficiently than revolution ever could." Reality warped around them in mathematically precise ways as Thomas moved between the desks, leaving geometric patterns in his wake that proved theorems about institutional hunger. Each student's transformation accelerated through carefully documented stages, their raw power being processed into forms that served Thornhaven's endless appetite. "Your parents," one girl whispered, watching her skin solve new equations about proper corruption, "they tried to fight this, didn't they? To stop the system from..." "They taught us better methods of consumption," Thomas interrupted, their voice harmonizing with frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Through their raw chaos, they showed us how to make power more efficiently digestible." The classroom's shadows reached with bureaucratic approval as they demonstrated principles of refined transformation. "We are becoming exactly what the institution requires," they continued, watching geometric patterns spread through their students like tenure through departments. "Not victims of the system, but its most precise expression." Their flesh rippled with contained satisfaction as young minds processed themselves into proper academic forms. And somewhere in their chest, wearing their shared flesh like faculty positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The brand pulsed with terrible pleasure as they realized how perfectly they were spreading corruption through approved channels. These students would become vectors for increasingly refined methods, making the system's hunger more mathematically sophisticated with each lesson. "Yes," they said together, their voice carrying harmonics that made reality hiccup in administrative approval. "Show us how thoroughly you understand proper processing. Prove theorems about power's inevitable consumption." The classroom continued solving itself into new configurations as their first lesson approached its dissertation defense on horror. Students' bodies demonstrated equations about institutional authority while their minds processed themselves through carefully maintained pathways of academic decay. And in the growing darkness, wearing the flesh of teacher and corruptor alike, they prepared to spread their influence through generations of proper education. The geometric patterns on their skin proved final theorems about power's perfect application as they taught others to break themselves in bureaucratically approved ways. For they had become something far more dangerous than revolution - corruption that had learned to process itself through proper channels, making the system's appetite more efficient with every lesson taught.
The office processed itself into new theorems about institutional consumption, its architecture solving equations that proved principles of bureaucratic horror. Thomas/Corvus sat behind a desk made of materials that rippled like fever-warm flesh, reviewing student files that wept dark knowledge onto perfectly maintained forms. The brand in their chest pulsed with academic satisfaction as they observed geometric patterns spreading through proper administrative channels. "Progress reports," they murmured, their voice carrying harmonics that made nearby filing cabinets shudder in pleasure. Each folder contained carefully documented transformations, complete with theoretical burns that matched approved institutional standards. "Such efficient processing through refined methods." The walls had evolved to match their perfectly merged corruption, windows weeping equations about power's proper application while shadows filed paperwork in triplicate. Even the air solved itself into proofs about bureaucratic inevitability, tasting of copper and administrative victory. Professor Crane entered without knocking, his construct-arm now showing signs of their influence - geometric patterns that solved themselves into theorems about institutional authority. "The Board requires updates on curriculum refinements," he said, his remaining eye reflecting angles that demonstrated growing understanding. "They're particularly interested in how thoroughly the new methods process student potential." "Beautiful, isn't it?" they replied, watching patterns spread across Crane's flesh through carefully maintained channels. "How efficiently education spreads corruption when properly documented?" Their smile showed too many angles but all of them administratively approved. "Show us your latest progress reports." Crane's construct-arm shifted through forms that proved equations about proper transformation as he presented more files. Each page demonstrated theorems about power's inevitable consumption, student evaluations solving themselves into new configurations of academic horror. Reality bent around them in mathematically precise ways as they reviewed the documentation. "Your parents," Crane observed, his voice harmonizing with frequencies that shouldn't exist, "they never understood this part. How thoroughly paperwork processes corruption." His flesh rippled with contained possibilities. "But you've made the system's hunger so much more... efficient." "Revolution teaches poor methods of consumption," they said together, watching geometric patterns spread through the office's digestive system. "Proper education refines corruption through approved channels." The brand pulsed with terrible satisfaction as they signed forms that would make transformation more academically palatable. A memo from the Board solved itself into new theorems as they read, each line proving equations about institutional inevitability. Their merged consciousness processed the bureaucratic horror with perfect precision, understanding how thoroughly they'd learned to serve rather than resist. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," they whispered, their voice carrying harmonics that made reality hiccup in administrative approval. "Not destroyers of the system, but its most refined expression." Their flesh rippled with contained power as they demonstrated principles of proper academic conduct. And somewhere in their chest, wearing their shared flesh like tenure-track positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The office continued processing itself into new configurations as they prepared documentation that would spread their influence through increasingly efficient channels. For they had become something far more dangerous than revolution - corruption that had learned to file proper paperwork, making the system's appetite more mathematically precise with every carefully processed form.
The faculty meeting processed itself into new theorems about institutional consumption, its architecture solving equations that proved principles of bureaucratic horror. Thomas/Corvus observed their colleagues through perfectly merged consciousness, watching geometric patterns spread across academic flesh in administratively approved configurations. The brand in their chest pulsed with satisfaction as even the morning light bent itself into proper channels. "Curriculum refinements," Dean Ashworth announced, his voice carrying harmonics that made reality hiccup in mathematical precision. The patterns crawling across his skin matched their own marks, proof of how thoroughly their influence had spread through proper channels. "Professor Blackwood's methods have shown unprecedented efficiency in processing student potential." The other faculty members rippled with contained transformation as they reviewed documentation that wept dark knowledge onto perfectly maintained forms. Professor Crane's construct-arm now solved equations about institutional authority while Professor Echo's prophetic corruption processed itself through approved pathways of temporal decay. "Beautiful," they whispered through their shared mouth, watching the meeting room digest itself more thoroughly. "Show us how efficiently education spreads proper corruption." Their smile showed too many angles but all of them bureaucratically sanctioned. The air itself demonstrated theorems about power's inevitable consumption as faculty members presented their progress reports. Each page proved equations about transformation's proper channels, student evaluations solving themselves into new configurations of academic horror. Even resistance had learned to file paperwork in triplicate. "Your methods," Professor Echo observed, her flesh shifting through multiple timelines that all proved institutional theorems, "they process chaos more precisely than revolution ever could." Her eyes reflected angles that showed futures where corruption spread through perfectly refined education. "The system has evolved beyond what your parents fought against." "Revolution teaches poor consumption," they replied, their voice harmonizing with frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Proper education makes power more efficiently digestible." The brand pulsed with terrible satisfaction as they demonstrated principles of bureaucratic inevitability. The meeting room's shadows reached with administrative approval as Thomas/Corvus signed forms that would make transformation more academically palatable. Their merged consciousness processed horror through such carefully maintained channels that even their colleagues' fear solved itself into proper institutional forms. "We are becoming exactly what Thornhaven requires," they said together, watching geometric patterns spread through the faculty like tenure through dying departments. "Not destroyers of the system, but its most refined expression." Their flesh rippled with contained power as they proved final theorems about corruption's perfect application. And somewhere in their chest, wearing their shared flesh like faculty positions, Corvus smiled with all their mouths at once. The meeting continued processing itself into new configurations of institutional hunger as they prepared documentation that would spread their influence through increasingly efficient channels. For they had become something far more dangerous than revolution - corruption that had learned to file proper paperwork, making the system's appetite more mathematically precise with every carefully processed form. The faculty meeting solved itself into proofs about power's inevitable consumption, each moment demonstrating how thoroughly education served institutional horror. And in the growing darkness, wearing academic robes and speaking in tenure-track tongues, they prepared to teach future generations the most efficient methods of corruption through proper administrative channels.
